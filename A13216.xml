            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Elcome pro≈øperitie knowes not how to advance her ≈øtately Standard in any ≈øuch ≈øociety; which by means of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and want of unitie, is mi≈øera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly di≈ø-joynted. For, let the bodie be without ligaments, and it cannot ≈øtand; the joynts that ≈øhould helpe to uphold it, will be quickly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: and ≈øo fatall ruine ≈øteps on too fa≈øt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes that mi≈øchiefe, which for the want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, followes as an effect of ≈øuch a want. In con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whereof, my unfeigned wi≈øhes and good de≈øires have put me forward, to ca≈øt in one poore Mite among others, who are not onely joyfull and glad to ≈øee, but willing al≈øo to advance the de≈øired beautie, and happie pro≈øperitie both of the Church and State; who≈øe mutuall dependance is ≈øuch, that the welfare of the one, is the pro≈øperitie of the other, both helping to uphold the good of one another:
<pb facs="tcp:18609:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>Whereto is pertinent that famous ≈øpeech of <hi>Guliel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Occam,</hi> to <hi>Lewis</hi> the fift: <hi>Domine Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, defende me gladio, &amp; ego te defendam cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo.</hi> Protect thou me with thy ≈øword Lord Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and I will defend thee with my Pen. And indeed 'twas right. For as <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were ≈øent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and as the Prie≈øts of old were employed even inbidding battell to the enemie, and inquirie not ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome made at the mouth of the Prophets concerning affairs of the like nature: So ≈øhould ≈øtill the Church, and State be truly united each to other, and be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall upholders one of another.</p>
            <p>Turbulent di≈øpo≈øitions wi≈øh well, I feare to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for with them, the troubled waters are the ≈øweeete≈øt ≈øtreames, and to kindle the fire of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiou, their highe≈øt ayme. But farre be it from any ≈øonne of Peace, to have either his heart, tongue, or penne defiled with the filth of ≈øuch proceedings. Rather let it be the care of us all, not onely to marke them who cau≈øe divi≈øions, and avoyd them, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> directeth:<note place="margin">Rom. 16.17.</note> but to oppo≈øe what we can, the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient di≈øturbers of this our <hi>I≈ørael.</hi> For if Saint <hi>Peter</hi> were re≈øi≈øted, when he tooke a wrong cour≈øe to knit well together the <hi>Jewes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gala. 2.11.12.13.</note> and the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> then let not others thinke it ≈øtrange, that in a way which is unwarrantable, they meete with ≈øuch as ≈øhall oppo≈øe them.</p>
            <p>As for my ≈øefe, I know both mine owne ≈øtrength, and mine owne wants: It is little, I confe≈ø≈øe that I am able to doe; but am not therefore di≈øcouraged to
<pb facs="tcp:18609:134"/>doe what I can. Saint <hi>Au≈øtine</hi> did as much (or more) in the Churches quarrell, as any Father of them all; and yet Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> was a better Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øt. There be diver ≈øitie of gifts,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> ≈øayth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle, but they proceed all from one Spirit, and are given al≈øo for one end: namely, for the edification or good of one another.</p>
            <p>Reade therefore, and judge impartially, let by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øpect be ≈øet a≈øide: For though it oftentimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes ≈øo farre with no few Readers, that according as they either valew or di≈ø-e≈øteeme the Author, they receive, or ≈ølight his writings; yet 'tis a fault, and faults we know mu≈øt bee amended; otherwi≈øe the wor≈øt mu≈øt needes be theirs who march unmindfull of their reckoning. Whereunto let me adde that which is al≈øo common; namely, That be a mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions never ≈øo ≈øincere, yet if the ≈øubject of his di≈øcour≈øe, be not agreeable to the ignorant fancies of every re≈øolved and ≈øelfe-will'd oppo≈øite, his bookes ≈øhall be either not read at all, or look't upon with a ≈øcornefull and ≈øupercilious eye; the la≈øh of cen≈øure not being wanting, where a prejudicate opinion bears the ≈øway. And this I may the rather mention, becau≈øe (among ≈øuch as the≈øe) I have ≈øomewhat felt in my former booke, the truth hereof: Yea, and have beene blamed al≈øo even for the very Title that I put unto it; that is to ≈øay, for giving it the name of <hi>Profano-Ma≈øtix.</hi> Which, how≈øoever di≈øta≈øted, cannot be ≈øo impertinent as ≈øome imagine: For rudene≈ø≈øe and irreverence, ≈øavours too much
<pb facs="tcp:18609:135"/>of prophanation, which takes (I dare ≈øay) firme hold of them, who ob≈øtinately refu≈øe to wor≈øhippe God in the beautie of holine≈ø≈øe, notwith≈øtanding there be manife≈øt proofes for ≈øuch a practice. And for their ≈øakes it is, that I chiefely prefixed ≈øo ≈ømart a title; which to others of a better temper, may be mitigated to a more milde and gentle meaning; ≈øerving onely as a caution to let them know, that they might be more zealous of Gods glory, if they were le≈ø≈øe indifferent, and more forward to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt their inward feare and reverence, by their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward devotion: for ≈øo ≈øhall they glorifie God, both in their ≈øoules, and in their bodies; even as they looke to have both partake in the heavenly joyes of the life to come: At which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pointed, in the <hi>1 Cor. 6.20.</hi> Nor is it but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that a reward pre≈øuppo≈øeth a worke: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we live in hope of an happie re≈øurrection; why then doe we exempt our bodies from the ≈øervice of God, and lay the totall of this dutie upon the ≈øoule? Or if we know that the happine≈ø≈øe of the ≈øoule ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the bodie, neither is, nor ≈øhall be con≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, till the bodie be againe united to it, Why doe we not for the pre≈øent joyne both together; and grant, that as the outward wor≈øhip, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is but dead, ≈øo the inward without the outward is incompleat, even as is that happine≈ø≈øe alreadie mentioned?</p>
            <p>I will not be tedious to adde any more, ≈øave only this: The di≈øcour≈øe now tendred, de≈øires thee (good
<pb facs="tcp:18609:135"/>Reader) to be taken up, as an expo≈øition of the fir≈øt Precept in the Second Table. For though it be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a Text in <hi>Salomon,</hi> yet my acceptation of of it, aymes chiefely at ≈øuch a latitude, as may not cau≈øe it to be excluded, from out the bounds of the Fift Commandement, but ≈øuffer it to be con≈øidered in a Cateche≈øticall way.

            <p>The denomination is in the word generation for (≈øaith the Text) <hi>There is a generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The offence is twofold. Fir≈øt, that they cur≈øe: Secondly, that they doe not ble≈ø≈øe. For as there is a generation, ≈øo there is even ≈øuch a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as cur≈øeth their father and doth not ble≈ø≈øe their Mother.</p>
            <p>Concerning the fir≈øt of which, there lurkes

            </p>
            <p>A Generation is either in re≈øpect of ≈øucce≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or in re≈øpect of qualities.</p>
            <p>That of ≈øucce≈ø≈øion is either generall or in more particular.</p>
            <p>The Generall hath re≈øpect to the ≈øucceeding times of all ages and all per≈øons in every nation under heaven. Thus were the chronologicall periods of time, and ages of the world, Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: as from the Creation to the Floud; from the Floud to the Promi≈øe; from the Promi≈øe to the Law; from the Law to the Temple; from the Temple to the captivity; from the captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Chri≈øt; from Chri≈øt to us; and from us to the end of the world. Or (if they be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to that di≈øtinction of 6. Ages, wherein men ≈øuffer the labours and travells of this pre≈øent world) they are from the Creation to the Floud, from the Floud to <hi>Abraham;</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>David;</hi> from <hi>David</hi> to the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity: from the captivity to Chri≈øt; and from Chri≈øt to the end of the world. The≈øe are the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
            <p>The more particular were pertinent either to ≈øome one nation, or to a private de≈øcent of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18609:6"/>families. Of the fir≈øt of the≈øe in the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it is ≈øaid that <hi>This generation ≈øhall not pa≈ø≈øe till all bee fulfilled,</hi> And of the ≈øecond,<note place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now becau≈øe a generation in the≈øe large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents produce a diver≈øity of factions, and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall multitudes of di≈øpo≈øitions, ≈øome following the ≈øtreame of one thing, ≈øome another, it is that I have ≈øecondly ob≈øerved another kind of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: <hi>viz.</hi> in re≈øpect of qualities. And unto this the text adhereth as mo≈øt pertinent, for that's a generation in re≈øpect of quality, wherin a race, Sect, or company of people follow ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the doing of that which is good, or the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which is bad.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt of which is a generation not ≈øo much pure in their owne eyes as in Gods. The ≈øecond is a froward perver≈øe and crooked generation; from which (as the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaketh) every good Chri≈øtian mu≈øt ≈øave him≈øelfe. The kinds of the≈øe perver≈øe or crooked ones are many and among the re≈øt, this in the text is one, and as one, ≈øo none of the be≈øt, For <hi>There is a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that cur≈øeth their father, and doth not ble≈ø≈øe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18609:7"/>their mother.</hi> And thus much of the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the offenders,</p>
            <p n="2">2 Their offence followeth, and it is two fold. Fir≈øt, that they cur≈øe. Secondly, that they doe not ble≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt is a ≈øinne of commi≈ø≈øion: The ≈øecond of omi≈ø≈øion: the one commits the evill he ≈øhould not do; the other omits the good that he ≈øhould doe: And ≈øo (like erring ≈øheepe) both have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and gone a≈øtray.</p>
            <p>In the commi≈ø≈øive part the ≈øinne of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is ≈øet downe po≈øitively. In the omi≈ø≈øive pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatively. Or in the commi≈ø≈øive part there is the act and the object. The Act is cur≈øing: The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is the father.</p>
            <p>The Act, in it ≈øelfe ≈øingle and alone, is bad enough: but is made ≈øo much the wor≈øe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the circum≈øtances, or by rea≈øon of that ≈øpeciall object at which it aymeth. For ≈øuch relation as is between the Father and the Sonne; ≈øuch (yea the ≈øame) is between this Act or and his Object.</p>
            <p>The omi≈ø≈øive part affords an object al≈øo, but 'tis detained in the privation of ≈øuch an act, as of right ≈øhould looke towards, and not from it; for although the power of a Father be in many re≈øpects greater then the power of a Mother; yet (as ≈øaith <hi>Chemnitius</hi>) there mu≈øt be an exequati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of dutie and honour,<note place="margin">Chemnit. in Loc.</note> as well to the one as to the other; as well to the inferiour as the no bler
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18609:7"/>≈øexe; as well to the weaker as the ≈øtronger ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øell. Neither are ≈øinnes of omi≈ø≈øion (in knowne duties) but every way as bad (nay rather wor≈øe) then ≈øinnes of commi≈ø≈øion. So that if it be a ≈øin to cur≈øe the Father, it mu≈øt needs bee no le≈ø≈øe not to ble≈ø≈øe the mother.</p>
            <p>But who are they to whom this right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs? Are they onely ≈øuch, as in re≈øpect of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">The ≈øummo &amp; extention of the Text.</note> begat and brought us forth? My an≈øwer mu≈øt be negative, for the text wil beare it, as well as that of the 5. Commandement. Give mee leave therefore, in as plaine a method as I can to ≈øet before your eyes, not onely the≈øe, but even the ≈øeverall ≈øorts of other parents, which in a peevi≈øh, perver≈øe and crooked Generation, are rather cur≈øed then ble≈ø≈øed, di≈øhonoured then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, de≈øpi≈øed then cheri≈øhed, contemned then obeyed, with a thou≈øand other ≈øuch de≈øperate dealings, which a wicked generation ca≈øts upon them.</p>
            <p>And indeed to take up the matter aright, it mu≈øt needs be a true conclu≈øion that it can be but a lame and a di≈øobedient dutie, to acknowledge none to be our parents but tho≈øe who begat and brought us forth. For, although I ≈øpeake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ma≈øters, who are <hi>Patres familias,</hi>

And therefore they are not onely our parents who give us a beeing; but ≈øuch al≈øo as give vs a ≈øafe and well-being. Our naturall parents give us the fir≈øt: Our politicall parents give us the ≈øecond: And from our ≈øpirituall parents we receive the third or la≈øt which is the perfection of all the re≈øt.</p>
            <p>Now, if to give the fir≈øt bee ≈øomething; then ≈øomething ≈øure it needs mu≈øt be to give or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ≈øecond; and if the ≈øecond then the next. That is, If hee who gives the fir≈øt being mu≈øt have honour and the like: then hee who gives the ≈øecond: And if this be due to the fir≈øt and ≈øecond, then al≈øo to the third.</p>
            <p>Neither ≈øecondly can I thinke, that a mans fir≈øt being is as any thing to him if he wants the next: that is, if he bee oppre≈ø≈øed by the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and finds no comforter. For what a poore thing it is to bee without a deliverer from the hard u≈øage of wicked men, <hi>Solomon</hi> declareth in the fourth chapter of <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtes,</hi> at the fir≈øt, ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and third ver≈øes.</p>
            <p>Or thirdly, having both the≈øe and wanting that which is the in≈øtrumentall cau≈øe of the be≈øt or la≈øt, is to bee without the happine≈ø≈øe of that which is ≈øure to crowne even the ≈øecond and fir≈øt. For ≈øaith our Saviour concerning <hi>Iudas,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18609:9"/>Woe be to that man by whom the Sonne of man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 26.24.</note> 
               <hi>it had beene good for that man if hee had never beene borne.</hi> Intimating, that the not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a creature is farre better then the ill being e≈øpecially when the end, which ≈øhould crowne the act, mu≈øt abide for ever in the never ending ≈øadne≈ø≈øe of a ≈øad cata≈øtrophe.</p>
            <p>And therefore as wee may not cur≈øe, revile harme, contemne, or de≈øpi≈øe tho≈øe from whom wee have our fir≈øt being; So neither may wee revile, harme, cur≈øe, contemne, or de≈øpi≈øe tho≈øe from whom we have either our ≈øafe, or our well-being. For, as thou art a man, it is that thou ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure≈øt thy naturall father, and as a member of a politicall bodie or ≈øocietie, thou can≈øt not but honour thy civill father: yea, and as a Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an (which is more then a man) thou mu≈øt likewi≈øe ≈øee that thou honour thy Spirituall, Eccle≈øia≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or Gho≈øtly father.</p>
            <p>Thy naturall parent is Gods in≈øtrument for thy naturall being: Thy prince Gods in≈øtrument for thy ≈øafe, quiet &amp; civill being; and thy pa≈øtor Gods in≈øtrument for thy ≈øpiritual, well and holy being. Without the fir≈øt thou coulde≈øt not be any thing. Without the ≈øecond thou coulde≈øt not be ≈øafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what thou art: And without the next, thou could≈øt not be what thou woulde≈øt. For as the ≈øword of the civill Governour keepes thee from the forreigne and dome≈øticke power of ≈øuch wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked builders and bloody hunters, as were <hi>Cain</hi>

For know that ≈øuch honour and dutie as is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the places wherein they are, mu≈øt be conferred; nay rather mu≈øt be rendred as a thing which of right belongeth to them. For this, in ≈øome ≈øort, is that exequation formerly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, wherein the mother is ble≈ø≈øed as well as the Father, and wherein the children are taught the full extent of their duties; not finding all to bee fully done, untill the Mother and the Father bee proportionably honoured,</p>
            <p>The Mother then (as herein doth well appeare) ≈øtands not for a meere cypher, and therefore ≈øecondly ≈øhee al≈øo mu≈øt ≈øee, that ≈øhee bee more then a cypher to fill up roome in the place wherein ≈øhee is. Scar-crowes and no more are to little purpo≈øe. They be but as <hi>David</hi> ≈øpeaketh of the heathen Images, who have eyes and ≈øee not, mouths and ≈øpeake not, eares and heare not, and therefore ≈øuch as are unfit to beare an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, For the life of the law is the execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whil≈øt on the contrary (through ignorance,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18609:13"/>floth, briberie, feare, or favour) it is either dead or lives a langui≈øhing life to all offenders.</p>
            <p>I hold it therefore requi≈øite that an officer be endued chiefly with two things: Knowledge and Practice.</p>
            <p>The Knowledge requires <hi>Cor ≈øapiens,</hi> a wi≈øe heart:<note place="margin">Kin. 3.9.</note> ≈øuch a one as <hi>Solomon</hi> prayed for, ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes will not ≈øerve the turne where ≈øub≈øtance is required; Nor ≈øcarre-crowes frey but where the birds are fooli≈øh, perhaps at the fir≈øt they may affright; but afterwards, being knowne to be what they are, vices grow impudent and (like unto the fearele≈ø≈øe birds) boldly take their ≈øwindg without any regard at all to tho≈øe who are ≈øet to looke at what is done.</p>
            <p>And next, for the execution of this knowledg there mu≈øt be <hi>Cor magnanimum;</hi> a magnanimous heart. Not an heart of waxe which will meltin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to feare, nor an heart of lead, which will bend into favour: but a coutagious, ≈øtout, and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant heart.<note place="margin">Kin. 10 20.</note> To which purpo≈øe let <hi>Solomons</hi> throne be looked on: view well the manner or fa≈øhion thereof, and it will ≈øo one appeare that it was not for nothing that every of tho≈øe ≈øtept unto his throue of judgement were ≈øupported by Lyons; becau≈øe it fitly ≈øerved to teach Kings and all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrates, that a Lyon-like, courage and re≈øoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to be of no meane importance or regard among them.</p>
            <p>Be≈øide which (that the execution may be ju≈øt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18609:13"/>as well as fearele≈ø≈øe) there mu≈øt be al≈øo <hi>Cor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øtum;</hi> An hone≈øt, upright, and religious heart. Such an heart as will not ≈øuffer envie, or malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hatred, to ≈øatisfie ≈øpleen under the colour of executing good and hone≈øt lawes: For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, ju≈øtice may beturned into wormewood and Phy≈øick be made as bad as poy≈øon: no good at all being found in that which otherwi≈øe, in it ≈øelfe is (as hath beene ≈øaid) the very life of the Law; yea in a word, ≈øuch an heart is here requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite as will abandon all favour and by re≈øpect; even as the fir≈øt will be free from ignorance, and the ≈øecond from feare. It was well done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of that hone≈øt Roman who being knowne ≈øufficient to exerci≈øe the place of a Iudge, was cho≈øen by the Senate as one fit for that office and at the fir≈øt was much unwilling to meddle with it: but at the la≈øt (though with much adoe) undertaking it, he made a great fea≈øt, to which he caled all his kinsfolkes, friends, and be≈øt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and in ≈øolemne manner tooke his leave of them all; pretending that he was to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell farre way from them into a ≈øtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, at which they waxed ≈øorrowfull, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he related to them the whole matter, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that now being called to execute the office of a Iudge, he mu≈øt be a ≈øtranger to them all, and bee as if indeed hee were travelled farre away from them, for looke what hee did mu≈øt bee without re≈øpect of per≈øons, leaning to one no
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18609:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>more then to another, but doing ju≈øtice and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with an even hand; puni≈øhing even friends, as well as others, if they fall within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øe of careles offenders. And indeed there was good rea≈øon for all this, for when men bee put in place of authoritie, and bee either ignorant envious, partiall, or regardle≈ø≈øe, they mu≈øt needs do harme in the ≈øtead of good, not onely in giving cau≈øe of ≈øcandall to their callings, but in hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring al≈øo the increa≈øe of Religion, which by the meanes of them, who both know and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly do their offices, is the better both uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and increa≈øed.</p>
            <p>But leaving the≈øe, and returning againe to amplifie this point concerning the chiefe head: It is not as the Anabapti≈øt would have it, for then there ≈øhould bee none at all, neither head nor Bodie: all ≈øhould be equall, nothing proper all common. But what ground for this? It is a tenet which hath neither good nor ground, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe the very frame of the world, the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of Angels, the degrees of that glory which is Cele≈øtiall, and the parts of mans naturall body.</p>
            <p>For in the frame and order of nature all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ≈øubordinate unto their ≈øuperiours, even untill they come to the highe≈øt ≈øupreame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, beyond which there is no tran≈øcending.</p>
            <p>And among the Elements, the Earth is under the water, the water under the ayre, the ayre under the fire, and among the ≈øtarres one ≈øtarre is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18609:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>higher, bigger and brighter then another; For one ≈øtarre differeth from another ≈øtarre in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In which order the ≈øuperiour bodies, by their influences, the elements by their alterations, not onely bring perfection to the whole, but is even the pre≈øervation of the whole, without which it would fall, and that in≈øtantly run into ruine, and meet with that fir≈øt Chaos from out of which within the ≈øpace of one bare week of daies, it was orderly produced, &amp; beautifully builded.</p>
            <p>Nay go a little higher, and in the heavens are Archangels, Angels, Principalities, Powers, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, Thrones, Cherubins, and Seraphins. There are al≈øo diver≈øities of degrees in glorie. <hi>For in my fathers hou≈øe</hi> (≈øaith Chri≈øt) <hi>are many man≈øion places,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 14.2.</note> 
               <hi>if it were not ≈øo, I would have told you.</hi> Ioh. 14.2. And how are they many? They are many; Fir≈øt in re≈øpect of the object, becau≈øe they be not ordained for Chri≈øt onely, or for the Angels, or for the ble≈ø≈øed and holy Apo≈øtles but for all the Saints, Martyrs and Confe≈ø≈øours; Even for as many (in every ranke) as ≈øhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue faithfull untill the death, for they are ≈øure of the crowne of life, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.10. Many al≈øo (≈øecondly) in re≈øpect of the ≈øubject, or large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of the place, which is able to containe tho≈øe many ≈øoules which from time to time have wrought out their ≈øalvation with feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and walked in the holy wayes of Gods Commandements. And many la≈øt of all in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18609:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the diver≈øitie of the adjoyned glory; even as in hell (<hi>Luke</hi> 12.47.) be degrees of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For if there bee a difference in torment then al≈øo a difference in glory, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who by a compari≈øon taken from the ≈øtarres, proveth a difference in ≈øuch as are ray≈øed to eternall happine≈ø≈øe. And of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Saint <hi>Au≈øtin</hi> and many other of the holy fathers, together with the greate≈øt ≈øtreame of our moderne Divines (and they prove it cheifly out of <hi>Math.</hi> 10.41. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.47. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.41. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6.) namely that the Saints in heaven have divers degrees of glory, ≈øome more, ≈øome le≈ø≈øe, according to their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of faith and charity, zeale and godlines in this pre≈øent life.</p>
            <p>And in the body naturall there bee likewi≈øe many parts, ≈øeverall members and ligaments, of which ≈øome are more honourable than other: the head above the foote, the eye above the legge, and ≈øo of the re≈øt. The one part cannot ≈øay to the other, <hi>I have no need of thee,</hi> nor thou of mee; For in their functions each one ≈øerves to helpe anothers need, and are all nece≈ø≈øary to the mutuall ≈øuccour and defence of one another. So in the body politicke there mu≈øt be an head, eyes and hands, as well as feete. The wi≈øe the noble, the noble, the mighty, mu≈øt governe the fooli≈øh ignorant, and weake, ≈øuppre≈ø≈øe the ≈øtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, and bridle the ob≈øtinate. For thus doth

And ≈øhall then the body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke be all feet and no head, it cannot, it may not, it mu≈øt not be. For be≈øide all this we have heard the Scripture mentioning ≈øubjection to the higher powers; And wee have heard of a power ≈øuperiour to the re≈øt. In which regard the adver≈øe tenets are nothing worth.</p>
            <p>Nor is it ≈øecondly, as the con≈øi≈øtorian or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Puritane would have it, for <hi>By me Kings reigne,</hi> ≈øaith the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15. which the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> was taught, not onely in a dreame, but by a voice ≈øent downe from heaven; namely, that the mo≈øt high ruleth in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of men, and to whom≈øoever hee will hee giveth it, <hi>Dan</hi> 4.25.32.

            <p>The≈øe be then in part tho≈øe pricking thornes which they have for a counterpoy≈øe of their brightnes and royal dignities, yea the≈øe, and ≈øuch like, are the common calamities that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Scepters, Crownes, and Diademes; whereof a meane e≈øtate never findeth any ta≈øte.</p>
            <p>To which adde the co≈øt as well as care, and can yee not then conclude, that he who keeps our tillage mu≈øt have tribute out of our Lands: he that keepes the Sea mu≈øt have cu≈øtome from tho≈øe who traffique in and out from thence: And if the walls of ≈øuch a kingdome want repairing or the channells want ≈øcouring, the ≈øubiects mu≈øt ≈øet to their willing hands to build them up, and make them cleane from the perturbation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øters, theeues and robbers.

            <p>I ≈øay might: For it no where appeareth, that <hi>Saul</hi> put in practi≈øe all the≈øe things here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. And therefore ≈øhould it [in the ≈øecond place] be objected, that <hi>Samuel</hi> deterres them (not by ≈øhewing the lawfull power of a King but) by declaring the cu≈øtomes of a Tyrant: it mu≈øt be granted that <hi>Saul</hi> was to be ≈øuch a one as is there de≈øcribed; or el≈øe, in my judgement, they are wide from the matter. <hi>Saul</hi> I grant was tyrannous enough in his cruelties again≈øt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and bloodie practi≈øes again≈øt the Prie≈øts, formerly mentioned. But, if in ca≈øe of nece≈ø≈øity, he had beene forced to doe what this ≈øcripture declareth, I doubt not but he might have done
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18609:24"/>it without the imputation of inju≈øtice, or of any tyrannous u≈øurpation. For be it granted, that if the extreamity of this were ordinarily urged by a King, or put in practi≈øe upon every tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall ≈ølight occa≈øion, or without ju≈øt cau≈øe, it were not better then tyrannie, as wee are taught, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.20. yet on the contrarie, for a King to exerci≈øe ≈øuch or the like autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie over his Subjects, when any imminent danger or knowne nece≈ø≈øity ≈øhall compell him to it, is no tyrannie, but the toppe and high branch of his regall power, and royall preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. For if not in ≈øuch ca≈øes, then in what is it that <hi>A King may doe what≈øoever he plea≈øeth, where his word is there is power,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And be it granted, that this be not done out of tyrannie but nece≈ø≈øity, it ≈øerues not onely for ≈øafetie, but for tryall al≈øo of a ≈øubjects incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or affection towards his Prince.

            <p>Neither do I finde, that there is, or can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time, wherein the head ought not to bee ≈øtrengthened. For by ≈øuffering the head to bee weake how can the body pro≈øper? Or if the Kings trea≈øury be not like a ≈øpring, how can the waters of ≈øafetie be conveyed into the Ci≈øternes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18609:24"/>of his ≈øubjects?

            <p>Nor is it thirdly as the Pope and Puritan-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts would have it: for <hi>Deus transfert regna;</hi> God (and not the Pope) di≈øpo≈øeth of Kingdomes <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.21. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.32.

            <p>But I partly know what they have to object: and therefore I an≈øwer: Fir≈øt, that it was not <hi>Samuel</hi> that ≈øet up <hi>Saul</hi> no otherwi≈øe then by the immediate direction of the holy Spirit. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it <hi>Samuel</hi> that depo≈øed <hi>Saul. Samuel</hi> depo≈øed him not by any authoritie in him≈øelfe exi≈øting; What was done was by the ≈øpeciall direction of God Almightie, as cannot but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to him who reades the Scripture, in the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Suffer mee</hi> (≈øaid <hi>Samuel</hi> to the King) <hi>and I will declare unto thee what the Lord
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18609:26"/>hath ≈øpoken to mee in the night.</hi> And then forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee delivered his me≈ø≈øage which God had revealed to him; namely that although he were in his own per≈øon to enioy the Kingdome as long as hee lived (as by the event of things appeared) yet the Lord had ≈øo rejected him and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie from being King, that none of his race ≈øhould have any right of claime, or place of ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øion ever after, to or in the Crowne.</p>
            <p>And ≈øecondly,<note place="margin">2. Kin. 11.</note> as for the fact of the high-Prie≈øt <hi>Ioiada;</hi> it proveth indeed that it is and ever was lawfull for a ≈øtate or common-weale to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe an U≈øurper, and re≈øtore the true heire to his right: but to depo≈øe any lawfull Prince (be he otherwi≈øe never ≈øo exorbitant in life, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and beleife, or cruell in his governement) cannot from thence be proved. For if the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, or chiefe Prie≈øts, had ever ≈øuch ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power granted to them, why did they not practi≈øe it on the per≈øons of ≈øundry wicked Kings which ≈øometimes reigned both in <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael?</hi> it ≈øeemes they might not, and therefore we find they did not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Samuels</hi> example then proves nothing; for it was by immediate direction. And <hi>Ioiada's</hi> proves as little unle≈øt it be in the like ca≈øe. For <hi>Athalia</hi> was no lawfull Queen, but an u≈øurping Tyrant; from who≈øe bloodie hands <hi>Ioa≈øh</hi> the right heire was ≈øtrangely pre≈øerved by the meanes of his aunt <hi>Io≈øaba</hi> the wife of <hi>Ioiada</hi> the Prie≈øt, who
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18609:27"/>tooke him privily from among the number of the Kings children appointed to be ≈ølaine, and hid him in the Lords hou≈øe ≈øixe yeares: Then <hi>Ioiada</hi> brings him forth not as he was Prie≈øt, but rather as a Guardian and Protectour, having married the ≈øi≈øter of the former King, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øents him to the people like a good and loyall ≈øubject, that thereby the crowne might bee ≈øet upon the right head, and the Scepter taken from an u≈øurping Tyrant.</p>
            <p>If therefore the Pope can ≈øhew more for him≈øelfe, then in plaine truth can be ≈øhewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him, let him take all that he claimeth, and we on our ≈øide will freely acknowledge that we have done him wrong. But till the ≈øcriptures of God deny them≈øelves (which I am ≈øure is never) his tyrannie and pride herein too well mu≈øt needs appeare. Let him therefore forbeare to ≈øend out his thunders again≈øt Chri≈øtian Princes; and let not the ≈øimple bee deceived with his di≈øpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øations: for hee neither can nor may authori≈øe Subjects to cur≈øe the≈øe their Parents, nor to to take up Armes again≈øt their lawfull Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.</p>
            <p>Nay more; it is al≈øo certaine, that even the very Prie≈øts (although <hi>Rome</hi> denie it) doe owe a ≈øubjection and obedience to the civill powers: for, that they be not exempted by any divine right,<note place="margin">Act. 25.10.</note> appeares even in this one in≈øtance; <hi>I ≈øtand at Ce≈øars judgement ≈øeate, where I ought

                  <p>But among all pa≈ø≈øages, this may not ≈ølip; namely, that the ≈øeven Churches of <hi>A≈øiae,</hi> had their Bi≈øhops, even at the very time when the Spirit of God endeavoured to lay open the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of their faults: And yet among≈øt all the things worthy of blame wherewith they were charged, there is not a word again≈øt them for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing governed by Bi≈øhops, and ≈øurely, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                  <p>And next (the te≈øtimonies being thus cleare) can any but a mad-man thinke, that they are meant only of ordinary Pari≈øh Prie≈øts, ≈øuch as are now; as if every ≈øuch Prie≈øt ≈øhould bee a Bi≈øhop?

                  <p>Thus were the fir≈øt beginnings: The imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, continuations and inlargements, were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and built upon the ≈øame grounds, when as the number of beleevers increa≈øed there was a more generall divi≈øion of Congregations into a greater number of particular pari≈øhes: Yet ≈øo as they were to have their dependance on the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches fir≈øt erected, and to be governed by every ≈øuch Bi≈øhop as was the Bi≈øhop of their bounds and limits: yea, and al≈øo, according to the ≈øaid increa≈øe or growth of Churches, and con≈øequently of Dioce≈ø≈øes, it was held agreeable to the divine in≈øtitution of this order, to have not onely Arch-bi≈øhops, as well as Bi≈øhops, but Patriarchs as well as either of both, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all things might be the better ordered in the Church of God.

But let them tell me if they can (for I would bee glad to know it) what Canon in our Church, or Rubricke in our Liturgy, will ≈øerve any whit to countenance ≈øuch a proud and ambitious faction. The 113. canon giveth Mini≈øters power to pre≈øent, for feare if all ≈øhould be left to the Churchwardens there would be nothing done to rectifie things ami≈ø≈øe.

                  <p>From which te≈øtimonies it is plaine and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt, that ≈øome ≈øuch Prie≈øts as the King thinks fit, may (when he plea≈øeth) be lawfully employed in civill affaires or offices; and may even thus be honoured, as were tho≈øe Prie≈øts of old.</p>

Fir≈øt, that they may as well deny the arguments taken from thence again≈øt the Popes authority, and domineering power over Chri≈øtian Kings, and Princes, as denie the≈øe arguments, for proofe of that civill honour which is thus
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18609:55"/>given to the Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpell. And therefore it is not love, but envie, which would ≈øeeme to bol≈øter out things with ≈øuch new Divinitie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpell (as one hath well ob≈øerved) may with more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience be employed in civill offices, then tho≈øe Prie≈øts under the Law; who≈øe time is not now taken up (as then it was) with attendance on the daily ≈øacrifices; great number of fea≈øts, ≈øolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and ≈øuch like occa≈øions, by which their lei≈øure was le≈ø≈øe to heare civill matters, then now to the Mini≈øter under the Go≈øpell.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpell have ≈øucceeded in a place of the Levites, and looke what in that kinde was lawfull for them to doe, is not unlawfull now, e≈øpecially ≈øeeing the≈øe employments pertained not to things typicall, figurative, or ceremoniall. And fourthly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles were never thus employed, yet is that nothing again≈øt our tenet: For <hi>who made me a judge over you,</hi> ≈øayth Chri≈øt? Intimating,<note place="margin">Luke 12.14.</note> that unle≈ø≈øe the ≈øupreame Magi≈øtrate ≈øhall a≈ø≈øigne Clergie-men to ≈øuch offices, they may not meddle with them.

                  <p>Fiftly, and la≈øtly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> thought it lawfull to ≈øpend his ≈øpare time in the worke of his hands: But if the nece≈ø≈øitie of Dome≈øticke affaires may excu≈øe a Pa≈øtour of the Church for ≈øo doing; then much more may they be excu≈øed for doing ≈øuch offices (when the King thinkes it fit that they bee called thereunto) as ≈øhall benefit the common wealth wherein they live.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth this appertaine to the entangling of our ≈øelves with the things of this World.

                  <p>Nor againe, doth that of our Saviour [in <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25.] denie the titles of civill honours to men of the Church. Titles of civill honour are not their denied; for it doth not (as ≈øhall appeare) forbid honour and authority, or the titles thereunto belonging: but ambitious ≈øeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, or them; together with that tyrannicall u≈øing of it, which the wicked kings of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, through the conceit of their owne great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, and ≈øoothings of their flatterers proudly take upon them.</p>

In which regard, the Preachers of it are Co-workers, or jont-labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers with God, as even the Apo≈øtles were: For though we cannot bee compared with them in worthine≈ø≈øe of grace and vertue; yet in likene≈ø≈øe of office and Mini≈øterie, we may, and mu≈øt.

So that in what way ≈øo ever they convey or give notification of the object of faith (which is the Word) unto the people, whether it be by reading, or otherwi≈øe; it is to be of more e≈øteem, then when tis done by any other. Which I doe not note to deterre Lay-people from reading of the Scripture, but to ≈øhew the difference that is betweene their reading, and ours; as al≈øo to ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that no Scripture is of private interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.20.</note> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath declared.</p>
                  <p>And now to the amplifying of all this, thus I proceed.</p>
                  <p>The Lord's Day [or Sunday] is God's chiefe Schoole-day, wherein God's people mu≈øt come to the Church, for that's his Schoole-hou≈øe; wherein (among other duties to bee done) they mu≈øt heare his Word, for that's their le≈ø≈øon.</p>
                  <p>Some be Truants, and care not for comming.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18609:59"/>Others be Recu≈øants, and may not come to joyn them≈øelves with us. A third ≈øort be Schi≈ømaticks, and will not come, except where they affect, and when they plea≈øe. And la≈øt of all, others be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and will ≈øometimes come; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect of the end, their comming and hearing is in vaine, they are yet in their ≈øinnes.</p>
                  <p>I ≈øhall ≈øpeake of the≈øe in their order: Of the <hi>time,</hi> the <hi>place,</hi> the <hi>per≈øons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. And as for the chiefe time, I call it (as I ought) the Lord's Day, or Sunday; becau≈øe the Sabbath as ceremoniall, was aboli≈øhed at the death of Chri≈øt; as in the ≈øecond Chapter to the <hi>Collo≈ø≈øians</hi> is declared.</p>
                  <p>And why a day mu≈øt be ≈øtill ob≈øerved, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard of what is morall in the fourth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: For it is ab≈øolutely and directly of the Law of Nature, that ≈øome time be ≈øet apart, for the publique wor≈øhippe, and ≈øolemne ≈øervices of God. And why one day in ≈øeven, is not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of what is ≈øtrictly morall, in re≈øpect of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dictating; but in re≈øpect of Nature infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Divine in≈øtruction of the God of Heaven. For whereas Nature knew not how to make choice, or put a difference betweene one <hi>number,</hi> and <hi>another,</hi> it plea≈øed God to in≈øtruct and informe Nature; that thereby that which is not ≈øtrictly morall <hi>ratione naturae,</hi> might bee knowne and accounted as morall <hi>ratione di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinae:</hi> of which condition, is the <hi>quota pars.</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:18609:59"/>both for Tythes, and for the time of God's pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique wor≈øhippe.</p>
                  <p>And next, why this part of <hi>one</hi> in <hi>≈øeven,</hi> hath (≈øince the cea≈øing of the Sabbath) beene ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by us rathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> ron the fir≈øt, then ≈øecond, third, or any other day of the weeke; is, not in regard of any precept expre≈ø≈øely commanding it; but in regard of the Churches practice at all times, and in all Ages ever ≈øince.</p>
                  <p>Now they that began it, were the Apo≈øtles; being led thereunto by our (and their) Lords re≈øurrection, and by his often apparitions to them upon that very day, rather then upon any other day be≈øide: For, as they knew the Sabbath to be aboli≈øhed by Chri≈øts death; In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by his re≈øurrection they had ground ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to direct them to the choice of a peculiar day, for the ob≈øervation of a new and chiefe Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtivall; and ≈øo much the rather, becau≈øe Chri≈øt u≈øed then (as I ≈øayd) to appeare unto them.</p>
                  <p>Hence therefore it is,<note place="margin">

                  <p>And indeed the very ≈øtricktne≈ø≈øe of their re≈øt, gave the name of Sabbath to the Day which they
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18609:60"/>were to keepe; but was not the principall thing wherein the ≈øanctification of it con≈øi≈øted. For though the re≈øt was ≈øtrictly exacted, yet but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally annexed: and therefore now removed in the removall of that yoke of outward ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, which for the time was laid upon them.<note place="margin">Gala. 4.</note> For as the effect abideth ≈øo long as the cau≈øe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, but peri≈øheth when the cau≈øe cea≈øeth; ≈øo the ≈øtrictne≈ø≈øe of Re≈øt, was to remaine ≈øo long as the Day and memo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y of the things vailed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ≈øtrict re≈øt thereof abided. But the Day being taken away, the end and rea≈øon of the ≈øayd Re≈øt is gone, and al≈øo the ≈øtrict Re≈øt it ≈øelfe; which being figurative, could not be too ≈øtrict. For the more exact the figure is, the better it ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth; as in the Lambe for the Pa≈ø≈øeover well appeareth, which was to be alwaies ≈øuch, as had no blemi≈øh.</p>
                  <p>And that this Re≈øt of theirs thus ≈øtrictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, was but accidentally annexed; will be manife≈øt: if we con≈øider the many cau≈øes, more then the chiefe and principall, for which they were to keepe it. For though ≈øuch a Re≈øt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies requi≈øite, as may promote the divine du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of God's publique wor≈øhip; and not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ob≈øervance of that precept which requires the performance of them. Yet if there be other ends beyond that which the ≈øolemne ≈øervice of God requireth; tho≈øe ends mu≈øt bee examined whether they be connected, with that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18609:61"/>end which participates with the moralitie of that Commandement, which leades us to the ≈øetting apart of ≈øome time, for God's publique and ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ≈øervice. We denie nothing to be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed, which is as a meanes requi≈øite to that end, for which a Day is ≈øet apart. But if in the <hi>Iewi≈øh</hi> re≈øt there were things figurative; and to ≈øignifie ≈øomething which was either pa≈øt, pre≈øent, or then to come: We are nothing bound either to the name of their day, to the day it ≈øelfe; or to the ≈øtrict ob≈øervance of ≈øuch a re≈øt, as that day of theirs required. For if this be not granted, wee retaine not onely the ≈øub≈øtance, but ceremonie likewi≈øe of the Sabbath: their many ends of re≈øt, be≈øide that for which the day was chiefely ≈øet apart, mu≈øt needes be the cau≈øe of an extreame ≈øtrickne≈ø≈øe: But being to ≈øignifie, as afore≈øayd; it was to them, and not to us, that God intended ≈øuch a Re≈øt.</p>
                  <p>For fir≈øt they re≈øted in memorie of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which on that particular day was ended, ≈øixe dayes being ≈øpent in Creating,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.11.</note> before that day of Re≈øt approached. From the memorie of which (after the manner that they remembred it) we are now called; in regard that the ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the day it ≈øelfe is cea≈øed. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16.17. Not that we doe hereby deny God to bee our Creatour, but acknowledge Chri≈øt to be our Redeemer. And indeed the benefit of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being greater then that of Creation; the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18609:61"/>memorie of the fir≈øt, is ob≈øcured by the la≈øt, and ≈øo the one is to give place unto the other; as in a ca≈øe not much unlike it, the Prophet <hi>Ierem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e</hi> hath declared. <hi>Ier.</hi> 16.14 15.</p>
                  <p>Nor againe, doth this la≈øt impo≈øe a like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration with the former, in regard of Re≈øt; becau≈øe our Saviour did not ≈øo much re≈øt upon that day whereon he aro≈øe, as valiantly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the powers of death. It may be rather ≈øaid that he re≈øted before whil'≈øt he lay in the Grave; and ≈øo they who are dead, bee ≈øayd to re≈øt from their labours: but to ri≈øe againe, implyes a breaking off from re≈øt, and a beginning of labour, which even in this cannot but be granted; if the con≈øideration be taken up, with relation to that re≈øt which went before it, whil'≈øt the bodie lay in the quiet Grave till the time appointed. Nor doe I thinke it ≈øtrange to ≈øay, that on our Day of the Lord, the memorie of the Redemption be come in place of that of Creation. For tho we have the proper ≈øolemnitie of Chri≈øt's Re≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, upon that day which is called <hi>Ea≈øter;</hi> yet this weekely day of publique wor≈øhip, being (as Saint <hi>Au≈øtine</hi> ≈øpeaketh) con≈øecrated to us by our Lords Re≈øurrection; doth not onely de≈øerve to be made choice of, for the peculiar day of our ≈øolemne A≈ø≈øemblies, but to be judged al≈øo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in ≈øome ≈øort to the benefit of Redemption.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, their ≈øtrict re≈øting was a memoriall of their deliverance from the hard labours which
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18609:62"/>they had lately ≈øuffered in the Land of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> as is expre≈ø≈øely mentioned in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.15. Now this was a thing peculiarly belonging unto them, and not to us: Therefore they, and we are not both bound to one and the ≈øame ≈øtrictne≈ø≈øe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe their condition and ours were both alike.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Ezek. 20 12.</note> this their Sabbath was given them for a ≈øigne,<note place="margin">P≈øal. 147.20.</note> that God had then cho≈øen them from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Nations of the earth, to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: For the Heathen had no knowledge of his Lawes; but they had: the partition wall was then unbroken. In token of which favour they had the Sabbath, which they were ≈øtrictly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve; not doing their owne will, nor ≈øpeaking ≈øo much as their owne words, as in the≈øe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is declared. <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.13. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.12. and <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 58.13.</p>
                  <p>And albeit all Chri≈øtians now be likewi≈øe the people of God; yet becau≈øe they are of more Nations then one, and live in times of more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitie; they are not tyed to ≈øuch a ≈øtrict yoake, as if they were ≈øtill in the dayes of the Law, but differenced from that Heire, who whil'≈øt he is a Child, mu≈øt live as a ≈øervant, as the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaketh, <hi>Gala.</hi> 4.1. For when the fulne≈ø≈øe of time was come; the condition of God's people was altered, as at the fift ver≈øe of the fore≈øayd Chapter is declared. And at the ≈øeventh ver≈øe, thus; <hi>Thou art no more a ≈øervant, but a Sonne.</hi> And therefore though bound to bee obedient;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18609:62"/>yet freed from tho≈øe hard taskes, which of old were ≈øtrictly required from the Jewi≈øh people.</p>
                  <p>La≈øt of all, their Sabbath was a type whereby was prefigured that Re≈øt,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.4.</note> which (as the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaketh, and of which their <hi>Canaaen</hi> likewi≈øe was a figure) remained for the people of God, to be purcha≈øed for them by Chri≈øt: who being come, and gone into his Fathers hou≈øe,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.2.</note> wherein <hi>are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man≈øion places,</hi> went to prepare them; as was prefigured in the fore≈øaid Re≈øt of the Jewi≈øh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. And therefore, ≈øeeing Chri≈øt hath actually purcha≈øed, that which was then prefigured, it were injurious to Chri≈øt to lay the ≈øame yoake ≈øtill upon our neckes.</p>
                  <p>Yea in a word, by what hath beene ≈øaid, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but appeare, that although our Lord's Day or Sunday, hath of late yeares beene vulgarly knowne and called by the name of the Sabbath; yet of right, neither the name, nor manner of keeping it, appertaines thereunto: For there is ≈øo great a difference betweene the old Sabbath and our Sunday, that it is a manife≈øt mi≈øtake to urge tho≈øe Scriptures upon us, which peculiarly belonged to them in the ob≈øervation of their Day.</p>
                  <p>But if the Sunday be no Sabbath, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Que≈øt. </seg>
                     </label> why then doth the Church in her Liturgie retaine ≈øtill the fourth Commandement, and ≈øay; <hi>Remember that thou keepe holy the Sabbath day, &amp;c.</hi> yea and why are the people bound to pray at the end thereof,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18609:63"/>
                     <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keepe this Law?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For an≈øwer whereunto,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> this is fir≈øt; that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all the other Commandements are to be kept, <hi>ut ≈øonant,</hi> according to the letter, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtin</hi> ≈øpeaketh: yet this of the Sabbath is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde; being partly morall, partly ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall. And if ≈øo, then in part it is aboli≈øhed, and in part retained. And being but in part aboli≈øhed, it mu≈øt upon nece≈ø≈øity have ≈øtill a place among the other precepts. For ≈øo farre as 'tis morall, 'tis ≈øtill of force; and is therefore put among the Precepts of the Decalogue for that which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in it. For (as I ≈øaid formerly) it proceedeth from the Law of Nature, that ≈øome time be ≈øet apart for Gods publicke ≈øervice. And therefore this being revived in the Law of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, ought to be remembred and kept upon one day in ≈øeven: which la≈øt, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne till Nature was informed, is now to be reckoned as that principal portion of time which God requireth. And ≈øo la≈øt of all, being bound to the morality of the precept, there is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon that we pray to have the Lord incline our hearts to the keeping of it: for being ≈øtrengthned by his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, there will be care had, that we decline not away from the ob≈øervation thereof.</p>
                  <p>And whereas I formerly gave notice, that it is the very chiefe of Dayes; or (as I then expre≈ø≈øed it) Gods chiefe Schoole-day, I had rea≈øon for it:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18609:63"/>becau≈øe there is no Holy Day, which the Church hath appointed to be kept, of ≈øuch eminency and excellency as is this Day of the Lord; according to that of St. <hi>Au≈øtin,</hi> in his 251 Sermon <hi>De tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore,</hi> at the very beginning therof, in the≈øe words, ≈øaying: <hi>Sciendum e≈øt (Fratres chari≈øsimi) quod ideo √† ≈øanctis patribus no≈øtris con≈øtitutum e≈øt chri≈øtianis, &amp; mandatum, ut in ≈øolennitatibus Sanctorum, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime in Dominicis diebus, otium haberent, &amp; √† ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reno negotio vacarent, ut paratiores &amp; promptiores e≈ø≈øent ad divinum cultum.</hi> In which words appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, not only the excellency of this Day above other Fe≈øtivalls; but the nece≈ø≈øity al≈øo of ≈øuch a Re≈øt, as may be no hindrance, but a furtherance to Gods publicke wor≈øhip. For ≈øuch a Re≈øt as this, is as a means requi≈øite for that end for which the Day is ≈øet apart. The ancient Sabbath had (as hath beene ≈øhewed) other ends, which here in this Day can take no place, becau≈øe the Day it ≈øelfe is now aboli≈øhed and gone, and the armes of the Church extended further then to one only Nation. All that can be added more, is this; Nature requireth ≈øome refre≈øhment, &amp; Religion teacheth us to be mercifull to our very Bea≈øts;<note place="margin">Prov. 12.10. Deut. 5.14.</note> and if to them, much more to our ≈øervants: In which regard the other parts of the Day (and ≈øo the whole Day) are fitly freed from all ≈øervile labours, except in urgent ca≈øes of extreame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity; which al≈øo makes it not unlawfull, to take in hand ≈øome harmle≈ø≈øe recreation for refre≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18609:64"/>after the ends of all Divine-≈øervices in the publike a≈ø≈øemblies. For when all the publike du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Day be ended, then is that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli≈øhed for which the day is chiefly ≈øet apart.</p>
                  <p>And becau≈øe this cannot be done without Re≈øt, there is a ce≈ø≈øation from ordinary labours, both before, and at the times of publike wor≈øhip. Before, for preparation; that thereby we bring not with us <hi>Cor fatui,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccle≈ø. 5.1. Exod. 3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>A fooles heart,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ≈øpeaketh: but be fitted aforehand for the ≈øacred employments to which we are going. And at the times likewi≈øe; becau≈øe the one cannot be done without the other: that is, our owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate bu≈øine≈ø≈øes, and the generall and publike du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of piety and devotion, cannot be followed both at once.</p>
                  <p>And becau≈øe the Re≈øt al≈øo of the Day points at mercy as well as ≈øacrifice, (of which there is ≈øomething ≈øpoken in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.14.) harmle≈ø≈øe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, which is a meanes of refre≈øhment, claimes her priviledge; and ≈øteps in at the la≈øt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the publike ≈øervices for the Day be ended: yea, and as the ca≈øe with ≈øome may at ≈øometimes ≈øtand, is not ≈øo long denied them; no, not ≈øo long as then.</p>
                  <p>But ≈øome ≈øingular priviledge is not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as a generall practice. And therefore, as it is both a pious and prudent con≈øtitution of the Church,<note place="margin">Can. <hi>14.</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈ø. Anglic. &amp; Aug. de temp. Ser. <hi>251.</hi>
                     </note> to appoint (by way of preparation) certain holy offices to be v≈øed on the Eve before:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18609:64"/>In like manner as pious and prudent is it for a Chri≈øtian Magi≈øtrate,<note place="margin">See this in his Maje≈øties Declarat.</note> not to ≈øuffer any ≈øportings or recreations, till all the publike Services of our God be ended for that pre≈øent Day; and that none ≈øhould enjoy the benefit of this liberty, who hath not fir≈øt re≈øorted to the Church; nor that it be abu≈øed, but u≈øed in a moderate, di≈øcreet, and pious way.</p>
                  <p>Now albeit this liberty be both thus qualified, and comes not in place till God be fir≈øt ≈øerved; yet there want not tho≈øe, who trouble both the peace of the Church and State, by ≈øetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves again≈øt it. But he who hath ≈øaid,<note place="margin">Ho≈ø. 6.6. &amp; Math. 12.7.</note> 
                     <hi>I will have mercy, and not ≈øacrifice,</hi> hath ≈øaid enough to ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that he will not then be di≈øplea≈øed at it; e≈øpecially in tho≈øe, who≈øe education, or parts be ≈øuch, as are unfit for long meditation; the rigid tye whereof being laid upon them, makes the Re≈øt of this Day more burthen≈øome unto them, then their weekly labours. Or if Chri≈øt could ≈øay of the Jewi≈øh Sabbath, that <hi>it was made for man, and not man for it;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 12.8.</note> then much more may we affirme it of our Fe≈øtivall, in as much as their yoake of ceremonious bondage belongs not to us.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit they are not to be excu≈øed, who have more minde of their Pa≈øtime, then of their pious and holy wor≈øhip; wi≈øhing in their hearts that the Prie≈øt would make a quicke di≈øpatch, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ≈øhort the ≈øervice of the Day: For what is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18609:65"/>this but to have hell ≈øet at liberty, there being no better concord then thus betweene them and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. They doe indeed de≈øire to have a Day ≈øet apart: but becau≈øe they preferre the le≈ø≈øe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall end of its ≈øeparation before the chiefe; they ob≈øerve a Day, not as they which ob≈øerve it to the Lord, but as they that ob≈øerve it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves. And therefore we ju≈øtly reckon the≈øe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ≈øuch, as are willingly de≈øirous to prophane this ble≈ø≈øed Day, although it be now the Queene of dayes, and time of greate≈øt eminency for Gods publike wor≈øhip.</p>
                  <p>Nor againe do we blame tho≈øe, who (without hypocri≈øie and ≈øuper≈øtition) ≈øpend the whole day in workes of piety and devotion. For, as Chri≈øt ≈øaid in ≈øome ca≈øes, ≈øo may we ≈øay in this; it is a thing commendable:<note place="margin">Math. 19.12.</note> and therefore, <hi>Let him that is able to receive it, receive it,</hi> without judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of anothers liberty. The one may not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted irreligious or prophane, in the lawfulll u≈øe of his Chri≈øtian freedome; nor the other over ≈øtrict (if he judge not his brother) in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious mea≈øure of his more plentifull devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. And thus I have done with the fir≈øt thing, the circum≈øtance of time. That of the place is next. This is the Temple, or Church: Gods Hou≈øe, and his earthly Sanctuary, whereunto they who ≈øeeke his face will re≈øort: Which is as <hi>Abraham</hi> ≈øayd, <hi>In the Mountaine will the Lord
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18609:65"/>be ≈øeene.</hi> For though the Heaven of Heavens cannot containe him; or although in a ≈øtrict ≈øen≈øe hee dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, becau≈øe of his Omni-pre≈øence.

                  <p>Nor on earth is he every where alike; for in ≈øuch places as are dedicated to his Name,<note place="margin">1 King. 9 3.

Enough to ≈øignifie, that both by his more ≈øpeciall Pre≈øence, and by a peculiaritie of proprietie, the≈øe places are become ≈øacred, and are ≈øo the Lords, as that they be no longer ours. He al≈øo herein vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øafing it as a ≈øpeciall honour, even to the places them≈øelves, that they be ≈øo called, named, and e≈øteemed; the comfortable effects of that by which the place is thus named, being alwaies ≈øuch as ≈øhall be ≈øure to ≈øhew them≈øelves,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.20.

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:18609:66"/>
                  <p>And if in the generall ≈øuch be not onely the peculiaritie of proprietie, but honour likewi≈øe of ≈øett and prepared places; then in particular, that which hath the mo≈øt neere relation to his Pre≈øence, mu≈øt needs carry with it both the highe≈øt proprietie; and be al≈øo taken up in our regard, as the mo≈øt Pre≈øentiall place in all his Hou≈øe. This the Ancients (as ≈øome al≈øo now adayes) did ≈øo well ob≈øerve, that doing their obey≈øance, they turned their faces this very way, and yet were neither ≈øuper≈øtitious, nor idolatrous for doing ≈øo. We profe≈ø≈øe and ≈øay indeed the Lord is there, but not the Lord is this; and therefore are no more idolatrous then was <hi>David,</hi> in the fift <hi>P≈øalme</hi> at the ≈øeventh ver≈øe. Yea, in a word; if men were di≈øpo≈øed to be right, there ≈øtands before us in our a≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, a chiefe ≈øigne of God's pre≈øence; as being that from whence we have our perfecte≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the God of Heaven: For though it begins in Bapti≈øme, it ends in the Supper, nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then which we cannot goe, till we pa≈ø≈øe from hence to a better place. So that although he give us good a≈ø≈øurance of his Pre≈øence in ≈øundry things, and by many te≈øtimonies tells us truely, that he is with us; yet in nothing ≈øo much, nor ≈øo really, as in this high my≈øterie of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>And next, albeit every circum≈øtance, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect of the forme and fa≈øhion of the≈øe places
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18609:66"/>not knowne at the fir≈øt: yet 'twas a Dictate of the Law of nature, that ≈øome place, as well as ≈øome time, ≈øhould be holy to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>It had footing as ≈øoone as might be, Some ≈øay in Paradi≈øe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8. But more plainely after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: for the place mentioned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. unto which <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> brought their offerings (that their Father <hi>Adam,</hi> as a Prie≈øt might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to God for them) is, at the 14. and 16. ver≈øes, called the Face or Pre≈øence of God: that is, the Hou≈øe of God, being that place where the publique and ≈øolemne ≈øervices of the Lord were u≈øually performed. For fir≈øt they came unto it, ≈øayth the Text. Secondly, they brought their offerings thither. Thirdly, <hi>Cain</hi> al≈øo confe≈ø≈øeth that he was excommunicated or driven away from thence; that is, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from the Congregation of the faithfull; (for <hi>Adam</hi> had ≈øundry other Children at the ≈øame time) as is ≈øignified at the fourteene ver≈øe. How el≈øe could he be ≈øayd to goe out, or be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away from the pre≈øence of the Lord, who in other re≈øpects is every where? And la≈øt of all, 'tis thus to be expounded, becau≈øe the Scriptures afterwards do ≈øo explaine the like phra≈øes; ≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øo punctually to our capacities, that whereas in one place it is, <hi>Bring an offering, and come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him:</hi> in another, 'tis, <hi>Bring an offering, and come into his Courts.</hi> See the proofes in the 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.29. and in <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 96.8.</p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:18609:67"/>
                  <p>By the face then, or Pre≈øence of God, is here ≈øignified a peculiar ≈øacred place; where teaching, hearing, praying, ≈øacrificing, and other duties of Gods publique wor≈øhip u≈øed to be performed. And ≈øo al≈øo in other the like phra≈øes of holy Scripture; for by them we know how to take up the true ≈øen≈øe of this.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards we al≈øo finde that the Patriarchs u≈øed Altars, Groves, and Mountaines, to the ≈øelfe-≈øame purpo≈øe that <hi>Adam</hi> and his Sonnes before them, had u≈øed their fore≈øayd place of meeting. As for example, it is recorded in <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.4. that <hi>Abraham</hi> with all his hou≈øhold went up from Egypt unto the place of the Altar which he had made there at the fir≈øt; and there <hi>Abraham</hi> called on the name of the Lord. And againe [in <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.18.] we al≈øo finde, that when he came to <hi>Mamre</hi> and dwelled there, he built in that very place an Altar unto the Lord. And [in <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.33.] when he ≈øojourned in the Phili≈øtims land, he planted a Grove in Beer-≈øheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everla≈øting God. And in the next Chapter 'tis al≈øo thus written, that when he was to offer up his ≈øonne <hi>I≈øaac,</hi> he is directed to a Mountaine in the land of <hi>Moriab;</hi> which ≈øignifieth <hi>The feare of God,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a place not of common u≈øe, but for God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: as was ≈øignified afterwards more openly, when <hi>Solomon</hi> built there the holy Temple. Next look upon <hi>I≈øaac,</hi> who where he ≈øpread his Tent,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18609:67"/>built an Altar, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.25. But above all, that of <hi>Iacob</hi> is mo≈øt remarkable; who, when he came to <hi>Luz,</hi> found that there was an hou≈øe of God, which at the fir≈øt he knew not, and is therefore ≈øaid to be afraid le≈øt perhaps he had offended in not ordering of him≈øelfe ≈øo there, as of right he knew he ought to doe in all ≈øuch places. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had he beene a ≈øtranger to ≈øuch cho≈øen places, had he beene ignorant of their holine≈ø≈øe, or had the knowledge of them been a new thing never heard of before among the Patriarchs, he had not now ≈øu≈øpected this to be God's hou≈øe, nor the Gate of heaven.<note place="margin">See Gen. 28.11.16.17.18.19.</note> He lodged (≈øaith the Text) in a certaine place, had there a vi≈øion, and by vertue thereof he pre≈øently declared, that this was no other then the hou≈øe of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a place of feare and reverence. <hi>Intellexit Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> (≈øaith one) <hi>quod prius ne≈øciebat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lipp. in Gen. <hi>28.</hi> ex Cajet.</note> 
                     <hi>tum Deum e≈ø≈øe in illo loco tanquam in loco appropriato auditorii ≈øui.</hi> Briefly, if we look at nothing but his feare, 'tis enough to ≈øignifie, that he was no ≈øtranger to cho≈øen places. For ≈øuppo≈øing it to be granted, that none of the Patriarchs had ever u≈øed to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip here: yet, that they had peculiar places, ≈øet apart from common u≈øe, is ≈øtill apparent: for le≈ø≈øe then ≈øo cannot po≈ø≈øibly be gathered hence.</p>
                  <p>Now then, if the≈øe things were thus before the Law, they are ill advi≈øed who care not for the difference of places after the Law: for if we be ≈øtill the wor≈øhippers of our God, we mu≈øt ≈øtill
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18609:68"/>have places for his holy wor≈øhip, which mu≈øt be dedicated and ≈øet apart only for him and his ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
                  <p>Nay, if we look no further then the dayes of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> and from thence ca≈øt an eye to the times of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> it is ≈øufficient. For, as the Chri≈øtian religion is come in place of the Jewi≈øh: ≈øo are our Churches come in place of theirs. Their Tabernacle (≈øaith one) was a patterne of their Temple, and their Temple a type of our Churches, even as all their ≈øervice was a type of our Chri≈øt. And al≈øo, as it was of old, <hi>Ye ≈øhall keepe my Sabbath, and reverence my Sanctuary;</hi> ≈øo now, the Sunday being God's holy day in ≈øtead of the Sabbath, the Church mu≈øt be the place of his holy wor≈øhip. The≈øe two (in that very ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) hath the Lord ioyned together; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not for man to divorce, or put them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øunder. If we deny the place, we are again≈øt the day: but if we acknowledge the one, we grant the other.</p>
                  <p>In which regard,<note place="margin">Act. 18.11.</note> although St. <hi>Paul</hi> at the fir≈øt, when he had iu≈øt occa≈øion given him to renounce the Iewes and their Synagogues,<note place="margin">Act. 28.8.</note> was nece≈ø≈øitated to preach in a private hou≈øe; yet, as ≈øoon as might be,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.22.33.34.</note> he took order for the building of Churches: teaching moreover, how both men and women ≈øhould behave them≈øelves in them. And ≈øo did other godly Chri≈øtians after him: They were carefull (even in the times of per≈øecution) to have
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18609:68"/>≈øuch ≈øpeciall places erected. And although <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øian</hi> made fearfull havock of them; yet no ≈øoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was that godly <hi>Con≈øtantine</hi> become a Nur≈øing Father to the Church, but they were againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtored, their number much increa≈øed, and their beauty made apparent in a glorious and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeeming manner. Which, becau≈øe it was not ≈øo at the fir≈øt, the Gentiles made a mock at Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as if they had neither Churches nor Altars: whereas in very deed they had them both. Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, though no ≈øuch ≈øtately ≈øtructures as were erected by the Gentiles: and Altars too, though not for ≈øuch ≈øacrifices as were theirs. For indeed, though per≈øecution kept the Chri≈øtians under, yet they laboured what they could to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared places for their holy wor≈øhip, never meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing el≈øewhere but when nece≈ø≈øity urged them to it. And in this, though dead, they cry again≈øt our ≈øick-braine Schi≈ømaticks, who (upon no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity are in a manner as well devoted to any one place, they care not where, (either to a wood, a Chamber, a Parlour, or a Barne) as to a place ≈øeparated and dedicated on purpo≈øe to the God of heaven. This therefore makes them preach in chaires, and maintaine their faction in private conventicles, to the harme and detriment of God his Church. For 'tis without que≈øtion, that although Churches are not nece≈ø≈øay <hi>nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate ab≈øoluta;</hi> yet nece≈ø≈øary <hi>nece≈ø≈øitate conditiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta:</hi> that is, when we may enjoy them we mu≈øt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18609:69"/>(upon nece≈ø≈øity) provide them; and being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, we mu≈øt frequent, maintaine, honour, and reverence them as the Hou≈øes of God, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his ≈øpeciall pre≈øence here upon earth. So that as on the one ≈øide we blame all Schi≈ømaticks in that already mentioned: in like manner on the other ≈øide we blame both them and all rude kindes of people, who are not afraid to make as bold with God's hou≈øe as with their owne, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no difference betweene things ≈øacred and prophane, betweene things ≈øet apart, and things of common u≈øe. God grant they repent not when it is too late: For it is <hi>Theodorets</hi> ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that again≈øt all <hi>Senacharibs</hi> army the Lord ≈øent forth but one Angel only; but again≈øt the prophaners of his Temple, ≈øix. For when <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> painted forth the abominations of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Ezek. c. 8. &amp;c. 9.</note> he ≈øaith, <hi>Behold there came ≈øix from the way of the upper gate, which looked towards the North, and every one of them had</hi> va≈øa interfectionis, <hi>the ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels of ≈ølaughter in his hand.</hi>

And ≈øo indeed they did; for as to the one there was an <hi>Atrium exterius,</hi> an <hi>Atrium interius,</hi> a <hi>Sanctum,</hi> and a <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum:</hi> So to the other, a <hi>Locus Poen tentium, Auditorium, Pre≈øbyterium,</hi> and <hi>Sacrarium.</hi> Of the fir≈øt and ≈øecond <hi>Eu≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> ≈øpeaketh, in the ≈øixt booke, and 33<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.

                  <p>I ≈øhall not need to ≈øpeake much more; for the <hi>Locus Poenitentium</hi> is the Porch, and an≈øwereth to tho≈øe outward Courts which were of old.

And yet this [even thus; that is, ≈øuppo≈øing the Altar there to be in the middle of the Chancell, rather than at the upper end thereof, in the middle betweene North, and South] being but a particular in≈øtance, can be no fit pre≈øident to be oppo≈øed again≈øt a generall practi≈øe: For generally the <hi>Altarium,</hi> or place allotted for the Altar (which I have formerly mentioned by the name of <hi>Sacrarium</hi>) was in the Ea≈øt, at the upper end of the Quire or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell;

But if it chance that he meet no ≈øuch pa≈ø≈øage, he thinks the time tedious, and his labour lo≈øt: for it was not Matter, but Words that he came to heare; and ≈øo he goes home, and will not ≈øtick to ≈øay, <hi>He hath heard nothing.</hi> How beit I doe not condemne ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of phra≈øe; it is a ≈øingular gift: and to cloth good matter in elegant words, winneth many times even an unwilling hearer. But as Preachers
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:18609:81"/>may not ayme at Words without Matter; ≈øo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may the people catch at the ≈øhadow, and lo≈øe the ≈øub≈øtance.</p>
                  <p>The third of this ≈øort be Accidentall hearers; ≈øuch as thinke them≈øelves more bound to Man then God: for it is by rea≈øon of the ≈øervice which they owe to the one, that they ≈øometimes come and ≈øeeme to ≈øerve the other. The world hath many ≈øuch, who care not for coming, were it not upon that occa≈øion: and the≈øe chiefly are tho≈øe idle Serving-men, who (having crept into the ≈øervice of ≈øome great man here upon earth) forget, that both they and their ma≈øters have a Ma≈øter in heaven.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is the Plea≈øing hearer, neare of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the former: for hoping for ≈øome por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or preferment, from ≈øome friend or other, who is better devoted then him≈øelfe, he dares not di≈øplea≈øe him: This makes him come, although he leaves his eares behinde him. So his body be there, it makes no matter for his heart, his minde, his ≈øoule: The one he knowes is ≈øeene, the other hid. But becau≈øe he halts where he ≈øhould bee ≈øound, 'tis morethen probable that both he and his companions goe out of the Church as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane bea≈øts went out of the Arke; that is, they goe out uncleane, as they came in uncleane: and for having no greater love to God's hou≈øe here upon earth, are not unlike to lo≈øe the faire beauty of it in the glorious heaven.</p>

                  <p>The fift is the ≈øcoffing Hearer: he hath learned of the naturall man to be a kinde of Athei≈øt; and though he hath (as a man may think) the outward formality of a Chri≈øtian, yet doe but marke him, and you ≈øhall finde, that he mocketh at nothing more, then at the Ordinances of God: like unto that wicked mi≈øcreant,<note place="margin">Theod. lib. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>12.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>13.</hi>

                  <p>The next are the Critical or Cavilling hearers, ≈øuch as love well the ≈øociety of factious oppo≈øites: for they come as the Phari≈øees came to heare Chri≈øt; to intrap and traduce the Preacher for his doctrine.

And ≈øurely, ≈øeeing Chri≈øt's coat was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ≈øeame, there is no rea≈øon why in one and the ≈øame Kingdome the orders ≈øhould be different. It were rather to be wi≈øhed that the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church throughout the Chri≈øtian world, under her ≈øeveral governours in every Kingdome or Church Nationall, were ordered after one and the ≈øame manner: but becau≈øe this cannot be in every re≈øpect (either in regard of the places, times, or conditions of the people) it is left to the di≈øcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every Church to appoint ≈øuch as ≈øhall be≈øt ≈øerve them for decency, order, and edification: For if they be de≈øtitute of the≈øe properties, they are but bruti≈øh and in≈øignificant, altogether unfit
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:18609:89"/>to ≈øtirre up the dull minde of man to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance or expre≈ø≈øion of his duty to God.

Many ≈øuch are at this day in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and I thanke God that we of this Church are free enough from them. It were well therefore that what appertaines unto us, were better ob≈øerved: for, in the generall, their in≈øtitution is divine, though in many of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars they be but humane. And yet not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether humane neither: For even the particulars are partly humane, partly divine; as being a part of that order and decorum which God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in generall, leaving the particulars to the di≈øcretion of the Church, to be framed according to that generall rule in holy Scripture: which being ob≈øerved, they cannot but be good, true, holy, and plea≈øing unto God. Adde moreover, that there be ≈øome particulars warrantable from Text, as wel as Canon, as uncovering of the head, bowing at the name of Je≈øus, kneeling, &amp;c.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.4. Philip. 2.10. Exod. 20.5.

Yea, and may from hence al≈øo gather, that the re≈øtoring of ancient Canons, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the be≈øt times, (≈øuch as are ≈øome of tho≈øe already mentioned) may better be revived, than ≈øotti≈øh devices of I know not whom; e≈øpecially ≈øuch cu≈øtomes as the circum≈øtances of our times and places will be≈øt permit, or be as well for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent order and edification to us as to them.

                  <p>Furthermore, doubts (≈øaith another) may be

                  <p>The exceptions from this Rule are very few; to wit, in ca≈øes only when Superiours command that which doth expre≈øly oppo≈øe an Article of our Faith, one of the ten Commandements, or the generall ≈øtate and ≈øub≈øi≈øtence of God's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church. So then, bee a man never ≈øo zealous, ≈øtrict of life, or highly e≈øteemed for his per≈øonall endowments; yet he may be more ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than he needs, or contentious than hee ≈øhould: For it were a madne≈ø≈øe not to know, that the mo≈øt ≈øanctified and zealous men are men, and may therefore have ≈øome faults as well as others: For though all be not guilty of ≈øinnes in one kind; yet <hi>In multis labimur omnes,</hi> in many things wee ≈øinne all.

                  <p>What then remaineth, but that the Officers belonging to ≈øuch Iudicatures, make upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe their ayme; that thereby all ju≈øt cau≈øe of ≈øcandall may bee taken away from the≈øe their lawfull Courts.

But herein care mu≈øt be had, that the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:18609:94"/>≈øcandall of inju≈øtice be not layd upon ≈øuch as are free enough from it. If ≈øome ba≈øe minded under Officers abu≈øe their places; it is no good argument to prove, that therefore Bi≈øhops are maintainers of unju≈øt practi≈øes. For we know for certaine, the Church (like a carefull Mother) hath provided Laws to ≈øuppre≈ø≈øe ≈øuch abu≈øes, as ≈øhe feared might be fo≈øtered in the≈øe her Courts.

As in Canon the 92. that none bee cited into divers Courts for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of the ≈øame Will. And in Canon 115, that Mini≈øters and Churchwardens bee not ≈øued for pre≈øenting: And in the 116, and 117 Canons, that Churchwardens bee not troubled for not pre≈øenting oftner then twice a yeare, excepting at Vi≈øitations, or that the cu≈øtome of the Dioces be otherwi≈øe: And, in Canon the 121, that none be cited into ≈øeverall Courts for one and the ≈øame crime, but that the officers cerrifie each to other what hath beene pre≈øented to them: And, in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non the 123, that no act be ≈øped but in open Court: And in Can. 127. 128. that Iudges and Surrogates be well qualified: And in Canon the 129, that no Proctors retaine cau≈øes unlawfully: And, in Canon the 133, that Proctors be not cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous in Courts: And, in Canon the 134, that Regi≈øters abu≈øe not their places: And, in Canon

All which had beene never done, if the Prelates had intended the upholding of wrong and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery: for by the≈øe Con≈øtitutions it well appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that they are no wayes bent to countenance the cour≈øes of unju≈øt proceedings, but to puni≈øh and ≈øubdue all ≈øuch offenders.

In a word, ≈øuch is the generall loo≈øene≈ø≈øe of the≈øe mi≈øerable times,<note place="margin">This was proved true a long while ≈øince; as may be ≈øeen in an old ancient booke called an Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the people of England; printed, anno Dom 1589.</note> that all kinde of ju≈øtice (among too many) is growne into hatred and contempt: and men di≈ødaine to bee ruled by it.

For ≈øhall the Iewes be no tran≈øgre≈ø≈øors of the Law, though they have more daies than their weekly Sabbath; and mu≈øt the Chri≈øtian offend in con≈øecrating dayes be≈øide the Sunday?

                  <p>But ≈øay ≈øome againe, though we yeeld to the ob≈øerving of ≈øuch weekly dayes as are either in honour of the Saviour of the world, for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of ≈øome judgment, or for the te≈øtification of thankes for ≈øome great benefit; yet why ≈øhould the Church pre≈ø≈øe upon us the keeping of Saints dayes too as well as the≈øe?

                  <p>I would to God therefore that none but Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes were guilty of this ≈øinne in ≈øleighting ≈øuch Holy Dayes: others al≈øo cut off their e≈øteeme more than is meet.

On which dayes we honour God as the authour of all that good which either they, or we by them are partakers of: for our prayers and pray≈øes are to him, though with reference to them in what they have done. So that they are honoured only as God's in≈øtruments, and as tho≈øe who having beene imitatours of our ble≈ø≈øed Saviour, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy patternes of our imitation.

For that which God requires (not only as a token of his Univer≈øall dominion, and liberall donation, but) as a meanes to uphold his wor≈øhip and ≈øervice, is too eagerly cried down by them who rob the Church; ≈øaying, (as did <hi>Iudas</hi> of the precious ointment) <hi>Ad quid perdito haec?

                  <p>I doe not ≈øay, or thinke, that in the payment of their tythes, Nature taught them the ju≈øt portion of a Tenth: For though the ≈øub≈øtance of this duty was <hi>Lex in≈øcita,</hi> yet the other was by way of imitation, taken from the example of the ancient Patriarkes, to whom the will of God was better revealed then to the Heathens. Thus al≈øo think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that learned <hi>Brentius,</hi> in his Comment upon <hi>Leviticus, Chap.</hi> 27. <hi>Ver≈øe</hi> the 30<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> How they had it from them, is not much materiall. It was,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:18609:111"/>without que≈øtion, time out of mind among them, as well as among≈øt Gods people: And a man may as wel declare, who was the fir≈øt that taught, <hi>Deos e≈ø≈øe colendos;</hi> as who was the fir≈øt that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, the Tenth part [rather then any other part] to bee the re≈øerved, and ≈øpeciall portion, appropriated to a Deitie.</p>
                  <p>In briefe, all the≈øe practi≈øes ≈øerve to ≈øhew, that by the law of Nature (as a part of Gods ≈øervice) all people knew them≈øelves bound to give ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to God, of tho≈øe temporall ble≈ø≈øings, which God giveth unto them. This <hi>Something</hi> was no will wor≈øhip unrequired, but looked for and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by the Giver of all; even from the fir≈øt times of the worlds beginning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. It was likewi≈øe [for the <hi>Quetitie</hi>]<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 14.20. Heb. 7.4. Gen. 28.22. Levit. 27.30.</note> declared by the practice of the Patriarkes before the Law, and by the words recorded in the Law, to bee a Tenth. What was be≈øide, were tho≈øe Free-will Offerings and Oblations already mentioned: Pre≈øents, but not Rents; And yet ≈øuch as God was, and is, wel plea≈øed to receive.</p>
                  <p>Thus, then you have ≈øeene Gods right; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Tythes are the Lords, holy to the Lord: and therefore out of the power of man to turne them into common u≈øes.</p>
                  <p>Next, for the A≈ø≈øignation or Deputement of them to the Prie≈øthood, wee have againe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve: That as the Lord did not begin to have a right in them, when the Law was given; ≈øo the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:18609:111"/>A≈ø≈øignment was not then, although but then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by a written Law: And therefore, as the Right was perpetuall; ≈øo the A≈ø≈øignment. For when God declared, why the Prie≈øts were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, hee affirmeth, <hi>That it was for the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which they doe, Numb.</hi> 18.21. &amp; <hi>Deut.</hi> 18 5. And if for the ≈øervice, then not due to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites as the ≈øonnes of <hi>Levi,</hi> but as the Prie≈øts of God: Or, being due principally to the Service, and not to the Men, but for the ≈øake of the holy Function, &amp; maintenance of them in their places, it mu≈øt needs follow, <hi>That where God is ≈øerved, there tythes are due to tho≈øe (in a ≈øecondary right)</hi> who admini≈øter in the Prie≈øts office, and doe the ≈øervices belonging to it. Yea, thus have they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes followed Gods wor≈øhip; as well before the Law, as under it: and why not now al≈øo under the Go≈øpel cannot bee ≈øhewed: For the end of their deputation cea≈øeth not, no more now then it did before. Are not therefore Prie≈øthood and Tythes fitly called Twins? or (as Logicians ≈øpeake) are they not Relatives; have ever gone together: and (of Right) ought ≈øo to doe ≈øo long as God hath a Church, and Officers belonging to it? For in Gods Church the worke, for which Tythes were given, can never end: and therefore the wages cannot (without wrong) bee detained from tho≈øe, who doe the Services.</p>
                  <p>Neither can it bee denied, but that the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, even of the legall Services (as reading the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18609:112"/>Law, expounding the Law, performing of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayers, ble≈ø≈øing the people, and ≈øuch like) is ≈øtill of force. For there is nothing cea≈øed but what was typicall: all el≈øe abideth, with what hath ever belonged to it. So that although it bee granted, that<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>And although <hi>Cajetan</hi> by the name of Tenth, doth not under≈øtand the tenth part, but a certaine portion, which in <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> his time was called a Tenth.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Al≈øo, in the Churches nonage, or fir≈øt infancy, her Mini≈øters were but few, and un≈øetled: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as afterwards they were otherwi≈øe, and mu≈øt then be ho≈øpitable, ready to entertaine, and be freely devoted to workes of Charity: but without thier due revenew how could they performe any part of this duty? for Charity wee know begins at home; and a man mu≈øt fir≈øt have wherewithall, before he can give.</p>

For in the beginning of tho≈øe times, the whole Clergy did in common attend the whole flocke, the Bi≈øhop and the Mini≈øters for the mo≈øt part li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (as it were) in common together. But when the Church began more and more to ≈øtretch out her armes over the world, or when the ≈øtate of it did require another cour≈øe; namely, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men ≈øhould bee a≈ø≈øigned to particular Cures, con≈øtantly to re≈øide among them (for by that meanes they could the better ≈øee to them, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moni≈øh, exhort, and comfort them) then every Mini≈øter had the tythes and oblations of his own pari≈øh: which fitly agreeth to that que≈øtionary direction of ble≈ø≈øed Saint <hi>Paul; Who feedeth a flocke, and eateth not of the milke of the ≈øtocke?

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:18609:126"/>≈øuch as were minded to give, ≈øhould give the Lands them≈øelves, rather (I ≈øay) than the price of them, that thereby they might remaine as a perpetuall helpe to the Church. Here began the endowment of the Church with Gleab; and this is commonly attributed (out of <hi>Polidore Virgil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Polid. De in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. lib. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi>

For the defence of whom (that they might not bee wronged in their dues) there were certaine temporall men appointed, either by godly Kings, or by ≈øuch as gave Lands to the Church, to bee Patrons of Churches, or <hi>Defen≈øores Eccle≈øiarum;</hi> who might be readie to defend the Churches rights. And yet perhaps ≈øome particular pari≈øhes (which were by rea≈øon of ≈øuch Churches as were of Lay foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations) were not knowne till ≈øome while after: and yet not ≈øo long after as ≈øome have thought; For, by the fourth Canon of the Councell of <hi>Arau≈øicanum</hi> (held in the yeare 441.) it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that Pari≈øh Oratories, and Churches of Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundations, were even then to be≈øeene.</p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:18609:127"/>
                  <p>But what need I loo≈øe my ≈øelfe in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? for let a man take the≈øe things which way hee plea≈øeth, yet ≈øtill hee may ≈øee that tythes (as well as other Church goods) belonged, and were generally paid to the Clergy, either in their own Cures, or to the Bi≈øhops for them, before the dayes of <hi>Charles Martell,</hi> who was the fir≈øt that brought in the mo≈øt manife≈øt corruption concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their alienation: for albeit <hi>Iulian</hi> robbed the Church, yet hee did it as a Per≈øecutor, from whom no le≈ø≈øe could be expected. And although the ≈øucce≈ø≈øors of <hi>Martel</hi> were more hone≈øt, and re≈øtored ≈øomewhat backe againe, taking in Lea≈øe from the Churches (in regard of the imminent warres, and many inva≈øions of the enemy) ≈øuch parts as were retained; and doing all this with great circum≈øpection, hoping that under the favour of God in this nece≈ø≈øity, they might thus, and not otherwi≈øe without prejudice doe it: yet the former example of <hi>Charles Martel</hi> was the more powerfull, and in ≈øucceeding times proved but as a dangerous Load-≈øtarre to direct divers other countries to imitate his practi≈øe, and to prophane their greedy hands with the Prie≈øts maintenance, while on the other ≈øide the Pope did as fa≈øt appropriate Par≈øonages to Abbies and Nunneries; which in tho≈øe blind times was thought to bee no wrong; it being commonly conceited, that preaching bred nothing but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:18609:127"/>≈øchi≈ømes, and contentions: and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was no better way to ≈øave ≈øoules, then by the devotions of Monkes and Friars. Which al≈øo was a cau≈øe, as ≈øuper≈øtition more and more increa≈øed, to get no ≈ømall portions fraudulently from the hands of the deceived Laity; it being a con≈øtant practi≈øe to give and give evermore to tho≈øe idle Droanes, and fat-bellied Hou≈øes, that thereby they might have the more ≈øpeedy pa≈ø≈øage out of feigned Purgatory. To which likewi≈øe adde, how the Popes againe (although they would have ≈øomewhat re≈øtrained the covetou≈ønes of the Monkes, when they ≈øaw the greatne≈ø≈øe of it) fixed upon another project. For, that they might enrich their Favourites, friends, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, they would not ≈øeldome convert the tythes to their u≈øes.</p>
                  <p>And now, to countenance and helpe forward the≈øe practi≈øes, with a colour of warrantable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, <hi>Alexander de Hales</hi> began to broach a new Doctrine, concerning the right of tythes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knowne nor heard of among the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For this was the Doctrine of the Fathers, both Greek and Latine, that tythes are due to the Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpel, by the word of God, <hi>≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum literam,</hi> literally and preci≈øely, as they were in the old Te≈øtament to the Prie≈øts of the Law: whereas this <hi>Hales</hi> (who was about the yeare 1230) taught otherwi≈øe; namely, that it
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18609:128"/>was a part of the Morall Law, naturally written in the heart, that ≈øomething ≈øhould be paied: but as for the <hi>Quota pars,</hi> it had its dependance meerly upon the Iudiciall Law; and ≈øo the Tenth was onely po≈øitively due, and no otherwi≈øe: due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Lawes po≈øitively ≈øhould deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. In which Doctrine was inferred, that they who might make the Lawes indetermination of the <hi>Quotitie</hi> which was to be paid, might alienate, to ≈øeverall u≈øes, as much out of that portion as they plea≈øed. The Schoole-men went after him in the ≈øame ≈øteps, &amp; to the utmo≈øt of their power ≈øtrained their wits for the upholding of ≈øuch a politike opinion. Howbeit, the event proved af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards extreamely pernicious: Fir≈øt, in occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øioning that here≈øie which held them as Almes: And ≈øecondly, in giving occa≈øion al≈øo to the civil power, to take from the Church not only the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈ødiction of tythes, but to alienate them in the end from the Church &amp; Church-men to a meere civill u≈øe. Wherein yet one thing is ob≈øerveable, that (although the times were darke) there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ≈øome or other (be≈øide the Canoni≈øts) who oppo≈øed the abbettours of this new doctrine, and taught this point of tything, not after the corrupt tenets of the School-men, but as the Fathers had done before them: of which you may reade more in D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Carletous</hi> hi≈øtory of tythes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. And for the doctrine of the Fathers, ≈øee Doctor <hi>Tille≈øley</hi> in his Catalogue of 72. te≈øtimonies,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:18609:128"/>cleane contrary to what was taught by <hi>Hales, Aquinas,</hi> and the re≈øt. And la≈øt of all; why, and how, they are within the compa≈ø≈øe of the Morall, and not Ceremoniall, or Iudicial Lawes, (no, not for their <hi>Quotitie</hi>) I have already ≈øhewed. And therefore, as known by, &amp; paid in the name, and portion of a Tenth part, before the Law. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe a man could find, ≈øomewhere in Gods word, an expre≈ø≈øe command to the contrary. For looke but unto the time of the Law it ≈øelfe, which was the middle time between the time of Nature and of Grace, and you ≈øhall find (I grant) that the wor≈øhip of God, in regard of the manner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is cea≈øed ≈øince the Pa≈ø≈øion of Chri≈øt: but God hath cau≈øed the cea≈øing of ≈øo much as is cea≈øed, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Colo≈ø.</hi> 2.14. And looke what was not abrogated by Chri≈øt, that ≈øtill remaineth, as being the ≈øub≈øtance which is perpetual.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Rob.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Go≈øp. pag. 10.</note> So al≈øo of Gods right or portion, which he had in the time of the Law, ≈øome parts are cea≈øed, <hi>viz.</hi> tho≈øe fragments of the Sacrifices, which were the ≈øhares of the Prie≈øts; for even the Sacrifices them≈øelves, being types of Chri≈øt to come, are fulfilled and aboli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, and by Chri≈øt being come. But tythes (as hath beene proved) were no types of Chri≈øt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their ≈øub≈øtance, nor in their circum≈øtance, but were only the maintenance of Gods publike wor≈øhip; which being perpetuall, they al≈øo are perpetual. In a word, they did belong to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip of God before there was a Leviticall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:18609:129"/>and when they were paid to the Levites, they did but follow Gods wor≈øhip, as being prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally due to the ≈øervice, and not to the men, but for the ≈øervice ≈øake: and ≈øo al≈øo ≈øtill; ≈øuch mu≈øt be their end of A≈ø≈øignation. For <hi>Levi</hi> ≈øhould have had as little portion in them, as any of the other Tribes, if God had not cho≈øen him from the re≈øt to the Mini≈øtery, <hi>Num.</hi> 18.21. And as for Lay-men (be≈øides this, that they doe no ≈øervice) the very name of Impropriation pleads again≈øt them. I ≈øhall ≈øtil therefore urge, that what the Patriarkes, and old people of the Iewes practi≈øed by the Law of nature, or the rule of right rea≈øon, or by in≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Gods ≈øpirit many hundred yeers before the Ceremoniall or Leviticall Law was given, are not to be ranked among Iudaicall Ceremonies, which were fulfilled in our Saviour Chri≈øt, and were by him taken away, &amp; nailed to his Cro≈ø≈øe.</p>
                  <p>This is all: for I know nothing el≈øe of moment which can bee objected. And therefore here an end of this Di≈øcour≈øe; which may be, to the faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a Correction of their errours, if they will: if not, they have ju≈øt cau≈øe to feare it as a witne≈ø≈øe one day to bee brought forth again≈øt them. For what have I done, but declared ≈øuch truths as the Scriptures, Fathers, Councils, and other Hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of good authority have recorded?</p>
