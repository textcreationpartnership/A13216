            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Elcome proſperitie knowes not how to advance her ſtately Standard in any ſuch ſociety; which by means of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and want of unitie, is miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diſ-joynted. For, let the bodie be without ligaments, and it cannot ſtand; the joynts that ſhould helpe to uphold it, will be quickly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: and ſo fatall ruine ſteps on too faſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes that miſchiefe, which for the want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, followes as an effect of ſuch a want. In conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whereof, my unfeigned wiſhes and good deſires have put me forward, to caſt in one poore Mite among others, who are not onely joyfull and glad to ſee, but willing alſo to advance the deſired beautie, and happie proſperitie both of the Church and State; whoſe mutuall dependance is ſuch, that the welfare of the one, is the proſperitie of the other, both helping to uphold the good of one another:
<pb facs="tcp:18609:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>Whereto is pertinent that famous ſpeech of <hi>Guliel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Occam,</hi> to <hi>Lewis</hi> the fift: <hi>Domine Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, defende me gladio, &amp; ego te defendam cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo.</hi> Protect thou me with thy ſword Lord Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and I will defend thee with my Pen. And indeed 'twas right. For as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were ſent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and as the Prieſts of old were employed even inbidding battell to the enemie, and inquirie not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome made at the mouth of the Prophets concerning affairs of the like nature: So ſhould ſtill the Church, and State be truly united each to other, and be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall upholders one of another.</p>
            <p>Turbulent diſpoſitions wiſh well, I feare to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for with them, the troubled waters are the ſweeeteſt ſtreames, and to kindle the fire of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiou, their higheſt ayme. But farre be it from any ſonne of Peace, to have either his heart, tongue, or penne defiled with the filth of ſuch proceedings. Rather let it be the care of us all, not onely to marke them who cauſe diviſions, and avoyd them, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> directeth:<note place="margin">Rom. 16.17.</note> but to oppoſe what we can, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient diſturbers of this our <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For if Saint <hi>Peter</hi> were reſiſted, when he tooke a wrong courſe to knit well together the <hi>Jewes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gala. 2.11.12.13.</note> and the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> then let not others thinke it ſtrange, that in a way which is unwarrantable, they meete with ſuch as ſhall oppoſe them.</p>
            <p>As for my ſefe, I know both mine owne ſtrength, and mine owne wants: It is little, I confeſſe that I am able to doe; but am not therefore diſcouraged to
<pb facs="tcp:18609:134"/>doe what I can. Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> did as much (or more) in the Churches quarrell, as any Father of them all; and yet Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> was a better Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſt. There be diver ſitie of gifts,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> ſayth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, but they proceed all from one Spirit, and are given alſo for one end: namely, for the edification or good of one another.</p>
            <p>Reade therefore, and judge impartially, let by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect be ſet aſide: For though it oftentimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes ſo farre with no few Readers, that according as they either valew or diſ-eſteeme the Author, they receive, or ſlight his writings; yet 'tis a fault, and faults we know muſt bee amended; otherwiſe the worſt muſt needes be theirs who march unmindfull of their reckoning. Whereunto let me adde that which is alſo common; namely, That be a mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions never ſo ſincere, yet if the ſubject of his diſcourſe, be not agreeable to the ignorant fancies of every reſolved and ſelfe-will'd oppoſite, his bookes ſhall be either not read at all, or look't upon with a ſcornefull and ſupercilious eye; the laſh of cenſure not being wanting, where a prejudicate opinion bears the ſway. And this I may the rather mention, becauſe (among ſuch as theſe) I have ſomewhat felt in my former booke, the truth hereof: Yea, and have beene blamed alſo even for the very Title that I put unto it; that is to ſay, for giving it the name of <hi>Profano-Maſtix.</hi> Which, howſoever diſtaſted, cannot be ſo impertinent as ſome imagine: For rudeneſſe and irreverence, ſavours too much
<pb facs="tcp:18609:135"/>of prophanation, which takes (I dare ſay) firme hold of them, who obſtinately refuſe to worſhippe God in the beautie of holineſſe, notwithſtanding there be manifeſt proofes for ſuch a practice. And for their ſakes it is, that I chiefely prefixed ſo ſmart a title; which to others of a better temper, may be mitigated to a more milde and gentle meaning; ſerving onely as a caution to let them know, that they might be more zealous of Gods glory, if they were leſſe indifferent, and more forward to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt their inward feare and reverence, by their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward devotion: for ſo ſhall they glorifie God, both in their ſoules, and in their bodies; even as they looke to have both partake in the heavenly joyes of the life to come: At which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pointed, in the <hi>1 Cor. 6.20.</hi> Nor is it but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that a reward preſuppoſeth a worke: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we live in hope of an happie reſurrection; why then doe we exempt our bodies from the ſervice of God, and lay the totall of this dutie upon the ſoule? Or if we know that the happineſſe of the ſoule ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the bodie, neither is, nor ſhall be conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, till the bodie be againe united to it, Why doe we not for the preſent joyne both together; and grant, that as the outward worſhip, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is but dead, ſo the inward without the outward is incompleat, even as is that happineſſe alreadie mentioned?</p>
            <p>I will not be tedious to adde any more, ſave only this: The diſcourſe now tendred, deſires thee (good
<pb facs="tcp:18609:135"/>Reader) to be taken up, as an expoſition of the firſt Precept in the Second Table. For though it be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a Text in <hi>Salomon,</hi> yet my acceptation of of it, aymes chiefely at ſuch a latitude, as may not cauſe it to be excluded, from out the bounds of the Fift Commandement, but ſuffer it to be conſidered in a Catecheſticall way.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18609:6"/>(perhaps) ſome ambiguity in the word <hi>generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> I ſhall by degrees therefore unfold or expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate what a generation is, together with the kinds thereof, that thereby it may appeare what the text meaneth by ſaying, <hi>There is a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Generation is either in reſpect of ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or in reſpect of qualities.</p>
            <p>That of ſucceſſion is either generall or in more particular.</p>
            <p>The Generall hath reſpect to the ſucceeding times of all ages and all perſons in every nation under heaven. Thus were the chronologicall periods of time, and ages of the world, Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: as from the Creation to the Floud; from the Floud to the Promiſe; from the Promiſe to the Law; from the Law to the Temple; from the Temple to the captivity; from the captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Chriſt; from Chriſt to us; and from us to the end of the world. Or (if they be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to that diſtinction of 6. Ages, wherein men ſuffer the labours and travells of this preſent world) they are from the Creation to the Floud, from the Floud to <hi>Abraham;</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>David;</hi> from <hi>David</hi> to the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity: from the captivity to Chriſt; and from Chriſt to the end of the world. Theſe are the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
            <p>The more particular were pertinent either to ſome one nation, or to a private deſcent of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18609:6"/>families. Of the firſt of theſe in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it is ſaid that <hi>This generation ſhall not paſſe till all bee fulfilled,</hi> And of the ſecond,<note place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k. 21.32.</note> in the Pſalmiſt thus we read,<note place="margin">Pſal. 109.12</note> that <hi>In the next generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his name ſhall be cleane put out,</hi> which (if we reſpect the time) is ſeldome or never more then an hundred yeares;<note place="margin">Gen. 15.13.16.</note> as is witneſſed by that of <hi>Moſes</hi> [in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.] where we read of foure ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations in the compaſſe or ſpace of foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe a generation in theſe large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents produce a diverſity of factions, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall multitudes of diſpoſitions, ſome following the ſtreame of one thing, ſome another, it is that I have ſecondly obſerved another kind of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: <hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of qualities. And unto this the text adhereth as moſt pertinent, for that's a generation in reſpect of quality, wherin a race, Sect, or company of people follow ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the doing of that which is good, or the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which is bad.</p>
            <p>The firſt of which is a generation not ſo much pure in their owne eyes as in Gods. The ſecond is a froward perverſe and crooked generation; from which (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) every good Chriſtian muſt ſave himſelfe. The kinds of theſe perverſe or crooked ones are many and among the reſt, this in the text is one, and as one, ſo none of the beſt, For <hi>There is a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that curſeth their father, and doth not bleſſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18609:7"/>their mother.</hi> And thus much of the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the offenders,</p>
            <p n="2">2 Their offence followeth, and it is two fold. Firſt, that they curſe. Secondly, that they doe not bleſſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt is a ſinne of commiſſion: The ſecond of omiſſion: the one commits the evill he ſhould not do; the other omits the good that he ſhould doe: And ſo (like erring ſheepe) both have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and gone aſtray.</p>
            <p>In the commiſſive part the ſinne of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is ſet downe poſitively. In the omiſſive pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatively. Or in the commiſſive part there is the act and the object. The Act is curſing: The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is the father.</p>
            <p>The Act, in it ſelfe ſingle and alone, is bad enough: but is made ſo much the worſe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the circumſtances, or by reaſon of that ſpeciall object at which it aymeth. For ſuch relation as is between the Father and the Sonne; ſuch (yea the ſame) is between this Act or and his Object.</p>
            <p>The omiſſive part affords an object alſo, but 'tis detained in the privation of ſuch an act, as of right ſhould looke towards, and not from it; for although the power of a Father be in many reſpects greater then the power of a Mother; yet (as ſaith <hi>Chemnitius</hi>) there muſt be an exequati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of dutie and honour,<note place="margin">Chemnit. in Loc.</note> as well to the one as to the other; as well to the inferiour as the no bler
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18609:7"/>ſexe; as well to the weaker as the ſtronger veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. Neither are ſinnes of omiſſion (in knowne duties) but every way as bad (nay rather worſe) then ſinnes of commiſſion. So that if it be a ſin to curſe the Father, it muſt needs bee no leſſe not to bleſſe the mother.</p>
            <p>But who are they to whom this right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs? Are they onely ſuch, as in reſpect of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">The ſummo &amp; extention of the Text.</note> begat and brought us forth? My anſwer muſt be negative, for the text wil beare it, as well as that of the 5. Commandement. Give mee leave therefore, in as plaine a method as I can to ſet before your eyes, not onely theſe, but even the ſeverall ſorts of other parents, which in a peeviſh, perverſe and crooked Generation, are rather curſed then bleſſed, diſhonoured then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, deſpiſed then cheriſhed, contemned then obeyed, with a thouſand other ſuch deſperate dealings, which a wicked generation caſts upon them.</p>
            <p>And indeed to take up the matter aright, it muſt needs be a true concluſion that it can be but a lame and a diſobedient dutie, to acknowledge none to be our parents but thoſe who begat and brought us forth. For, although I ſpeake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of maſters, who are <hi>Patres familias,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kin. 5.13.</note> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of a family, or although I ſpeake nothing of the Aged who are Elders, and muſt bee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured as fathers.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.1.2.</note> Although (I ſay) nothing be ſpoken of theſe, or of ſome others which by

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:18609:9"/>way of eminency have a prerogative that pleads for their honour, we have beſides them, yea and beſides our Natural parents alſo, even fathers of the Church, and of the common wealth. And therefore they are not onely our parents who give us a beeing; but ſuch alſo as give vs a ſafe and well-being. Our naturall parents give us the firſt: Our politicall parents give us the ſecond: And from our ſpirituall parents we receive the third or laſt which is the perfection of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Now, if to give the firſt bee ſomething; then ſomething ſure it needs muſt be to give or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſecond; and if the ſecond then the next. That is, If hee who gives the firſt being muſt have honour and the like: then hee who gives the ſecond: And if this be due to the firſt and ſecond, then alſo to the third.</p>
            <p>Neither ſecondly can I thinke, that a mans firſt being is as any thing to him if he wants the next: that is, if he bee oppreſſed by the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and finds no comforter. For what a poore thing it is to bee without a deliverer from the hard uſage of wicked men, <hi>Solomon</hi> declareth in the fourth chapter of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> at the firſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and third verſes.</p>
            <p>Or thirdly, having both theſe and wanting that which is the inſtrumentall cauſe of the beſt or laſt, is to bee without the happineſſe of that which is ſure to crowne even the ſecond and firſt. For ſaith our Saviour concerning <hi>Iudas,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18609:9"/>Woe be to that man by whom the Sonne of man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 26.24.</note> 
               <hi>it had beene good for that man if hee had never beene borne.</hi> Intimating, that the not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a creature is farre better then the ill being eſpecially when the end, which ſhould crowne the act, muſt abide for ever in the never ending ſadneſſe of a ſad cataſtrophe.</p>
            <p>And therefore as wee may not curſe, revile harme, contemne, or deſpiſe thoſe from whom wee have our firſt being; So neither may wee revile, harme, curſe, contemne, or deſpiſe thoſe from whom we have either our ſafe, or our well-being. For, as thou art a man, it is that thou ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureſt thy naturall father, and as a member of a politicall bodie or ſocietie, thou canſt not but honour thy civill father: yea, and as a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an (which is more then a man) thou muſt likewiſe ſee that thou honour thy Spirituall, Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or Ghoſtly father.</p>
            <p>Thy naturall parent is Gods inſtrument for thy naturall being: Thy prince Gods inſtrument for thy ſafe, quiet &amp; civill being; and thy paſtor Gods inſtrument for thy ſpiritual, well and holy being. Without the firſt thou couldeſt not be any thing. Without the ſecond thou couldeſt not be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what thou art: And without the next, thou couldſt not be what thou wouldeſt. For as the ſword of the civill Governour keepes thee from the forreigne and domeſticke power of ſuch wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked builders and bloody hunters, as were <hi>Cain</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:18609:10"/>and <hi>Nimrod:</hi> So the ſword of Gods Miniſter keepeth thee from the ſnatching pawes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, that ſworn enemy of all mankind,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.8.</note> who (like a roaring Lyon) ramps up and downe, ſeeking whom he may devoure.</p>
            <p>Theſe then are the chiefe Fatherhoods of greateſt note: the one wherof may be no more curſed then the other, nor the other leſſe bleſſed then the firſt. Concerning whom, I will both reſolve the doubtfull, and convince the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veliſh, that thus they are; yea, and thus muſt they be honoured: <hi>Aequè,</hi> but not <hi>aequalitèr;</hi> Iuſtly and fitly as of right is meet and due, but not all of a juſt and equall portion.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The firſt, which be our naturall parents, are called <hi>Fathers of our fleſh,</hi> Heb. 12.9. <hi>For we have had fathers of the fleſh that corrected us, and wee gave them reverence,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. And not without juſt cauſe,<note place="margin">Prov. 20.20.</note> for <hi>Who ſo curſeth his father or his Mother, ſhall have his lampe put out in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure darkneſſe.</hi> Looke therefore what it mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and perhaps you ſhall finde that they die the death of the damned, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.20. Or, as it is at the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. verſe of this very Chapter, <hi>The ravens of the vallies ſhall picke out their eyes, and the young eagles ſhall eate them.</hi> Shall pick out the eye ſaith <hi>Iunius?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iun. in annot. in <hi>Prov. 30.17.</hi>
               </note> that is, <hi>Filium immorige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, aut parentibus iniquum, in malam rem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnabit Deus.</hi> God (ſaith hee) ſhall condemne he diſobedient and wicked child into ſome great
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18609:10"/>miſcheife, ſignified by that phraſe of <hi>picking out and eating up their eyes</hi> To which I cannot but adde a ſecond gloſſe, namely that if the ſpeech be figurative, then may theſe birds of prey (by an allegorie) bee taken for the damned Divels, with whom theſe deſperate ſinners ſhall (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance) have their deſerved puniſhment; For he that honoureth not his earthly parents whom he hath ſeene, will ſcarce honour God as his heavenly father whom he hath not ſeene: and ſo being obſtinately rebellious; and wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty of the breach of both Tables, muſt needs (continuing ſo) be damned, die and periſh everlaſtingly.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The ſecond are <hi>Patres Patriae,</hi> Fathers of their countrey, as Kings, cheife Magiſtrates, and Rulers bearing office in the common-weale. Thus was <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſtiled, even by the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, among the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> For being advanced unto honour by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> (as we read in Geneſis, chap. 41.43.) the people went before him with a joyful acclamation, crying out and ſaying, <hi>Abrech:</hi> which (as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it) ſignifies <hi>a young and tender Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hier. trad. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Thus alſo did the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> call their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours; They were <hi>Patres conſcripti, Fathers upon record:</hi> and to attaine to this, to be entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18609:11"/>a father of their country, they eſteemed it the beſt and the greateſt honor. For thus (I ſay) did even the Law of nature, teach them to reverence the perſons of their governours, and to give them that honourable title and ſtile of Fathers.</p>
            <p>So alſo <hi>Ioſhua</hi> (the cheife Magiſtrate after <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was dead,) called <hi>Achan</hi> by the name of ſon <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 7.19. Now ſonne, by way of relation, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes a Father, as even in the termes of Logick is apparent where both the relative and correla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive anſwer to one another. <hi>David</hi> alſo (in the firſt booke of <hi>Samuel</hi>) ſpake thus unto the King and ſaid;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24.11.</note> 
               <hi>My father ſee, yea ſee the ſkirt of thy robe in my hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So alſo (in the ſecond booke of the <hi>Chronicles</hi>) the cheife rulers are called the chiefe fathers of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Neither doe the ſcriptures but affirme, that king <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was a father over the fathers of his people, even over the Prieſts, and therfore much more over the reſt of his ſubjects as it is in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.11.</p>
            <p>And againe, Kings and Queenes are ſtiled by the prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi>

            <p>And of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> it is againe recorded, that God made him a father with <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> as <hi>Iunius</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.8. <hi>A father with him,</hi> although not above him: for in this, both he, and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther governours, muſt be inferiour.

            <p>Where againe obſerve, that the bleſſing or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is pertinent to the Mother (who is the weaker veſſell) may in this place ſtand to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that not the meaneſt officer, which the King (our ſupreame governour here on earth) ſhall conſtitute, may bee curſed or deſpiſed. For know that ſuch honour and dutie as is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the places wherein they are, muſt be conferred; nay rather muſt be rendred as a thing which of right belongeth to them. For this, in ſome ſort, is that exequation formerly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, wherein the mother is bleſſed as well as the Father, and wherein the children are taught the full extent of their duties; not finding all to bee fully done, untill the Mother and the Father bee proportionably honoured,</p>
            <p>The Mother then (as herein doth well appeare) ſtands not for a meere cypher, and therefore ſecondly ſhee alſo muſt ſee, that ſhee bee more then a cypher to fill up roome in the place wherein ſhee is. Scar-crowes and no more are to little purpoſe. They be but as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of the heathen Images, who have eyes and ſee not, mouths and ſpeake not, eares and heare not, and therefore ſuch as are unfit to beare an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, For the life of the law is the execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whilſt on the contrary (through ignorance,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18609:13"/>floth, briberie, feare, or favour) it is either dead or lives a languiſhing life to all offenders.</p>
            <p>I hold it therefore requiſite that an officer be endued chiefly with two things: Knowledge and Practice.</p>
            <p>The Knowledge requires <hi>Cor ſapiens,</hi> a wiſe heart:<note place="margin">Kin. 3.9.</note> ſuch a one as <hi>Solomon</hi> prayed for, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes will not ſerve the turne where ſubſtance is required; Nor ſcarre-crowes frey but where the birds are fooliſh, perhaps at the firſt they may affright; but afterwards, being knowne to be what they are, vices grow impudent and (like unto the feareleſſe birds) boldly take their ſwindg without any regard at all to thoſe who are ſet to looke at what is done.</p>
            <p>And next, for the execution of this knowledg there muſt be <hi>Cor magnanimum;</hi> a magnanimous heart. Not an heart of waxe which will meltin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to feare, nor an heart of lead, which will bend into favour: but a coutagious, ſtout, and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant heart.<note place="margin">Kin. 10 20.</note> To which purpoſe let <hi>Solomons</hi> throne be looked on: view well the manner or faſhion thereof, and it will ſo one appeare that it was not for nothing that every of thoſe ſtept unto his throue of judgement were ſupported by Lyons; becauſe it fitly ſerved to teach Kings and all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, that a Lyon-like, courage and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to be of no meane importance or regard among them.</p>
            <p>Beſide which (that the execution may be juſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18609:13"/>as well as feareleſſe) there muſt be alſo <hi>Cor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtum;</hi> An honeſt, upright, and religious heart. Such an heart as will not ſuffer envie, or malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hatred, to ſatisfie ſpleen under the colour of executing good and honeſt lawes: For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, juſtice may beturned into wormewood and Phyſick be made as bad as poyſon: no good at all being found in that which otherwiſe, in it ſelfe is (as hath beene ſaid) the very life of the Law; yea in a word, ſuch an heart is here requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite as will abandon all favour and by reſpect; even as the firſt will be free from ignorance, and the ſecond from feare. It was well done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of that honeſt Roman who being knowne ſufficient to exerciſe the place of a Iudge, was choſen by the Senate as one fit for that office and at the firſt was much unwilling to meddle with it: but at the laſt (though with much adoe) undertaking it, he made a great feaſt, to which he caled all his kinsfolkes, friends, and beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and in ſolemne manner tooke his leave of them all; pretending that he was to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell farre way from them into a ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, at which they waxed ſorrowfull, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he related to them the whole matter, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that now being called to execute the office of a Iudge, he muſt be a ſtranger to them all, and bee as if indeed hee were travelled farre away from them, for looke what hee did muſt bee without reſpect of perſons, leaning to one no

And indeed there was good reaſon for all this, for when men bee put in place of authoritie, and bee either ignorant envious, partiall, or regardleſſe, they muſt needs do harme in the ſtead of good, not onely in giving cauſe of ſcandall to their callings, but in hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring alſo the increaſe of Religion, which by the meanes of them, who both know and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly do their offices, is the better both uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and increaſed.</p>
            <p>But leaving theſe, and returning againe to amplifie this point concerning the chiefe head: It is not as the Anabaptiſt would have it, for then there ſhould bee none at all, neither head nor Bodie: all ſhould be equall, nothing proper all common. But what ground for this? It is a tenet which hath neither good nor ground, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the very frame of the world, the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of Angels, the degrees of that glory which is Celeſtiall, and the parts of mans naturall body.</p>
            <p>For in the frame and order of nature all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſubordinate unto their ſuperiours, even untill they come to the higheſt ſupreame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, beyond which there is no tranſcending.</p>
            <p>And among the Elements, the Earth is under the water, the water under the ayre, the ayre under the fire, and among the ſtarres one ſtarre is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18609:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>higher, bigger and brighter then another; For one ſtarre differeth from another ſtarre in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In which order the ſuperiour bodies, by their influences, the elements by their alterations, not onely bring perfection to the whole, but is even the preſervation of the whole, without which it would fall, and that inſtantly run into ruine, and meet with that firſt Chaos from out of which within the ſpace of one bare week of daies, it was orderly produced, &amp; beautifully builded.</p>
            <p>Nay go a little higher, and in the heavens are Archangels, Angels, Principalities, Powers, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, Thrones, Cherubins, and Seraphins. There are alſo diverſities of degrees in glorie. <hi>For in my fathers houſe</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>are many manſion places,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 14.2.</note> 
               <hi>if it were not ſo, I would have told you.</hi> Ioh. 14.2. And how are they many? They are many; Firſt in reſpect of the object, becauſe they be not ordained for Chriſt onely, or for the Angels, or for the bleſſed and holy Apoſtles but for all the Saints, Martyrs and Confeſſours; Even for as many (in every ranke) as ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue faithfull untill the death, for they are ſure of the crowne of life, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.10. Many alſo (ſecondly) in reſpect of the ſubject, or large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the place, which is able to containe thoſe many ſoules which from time to time have wrought out their ſalvation with feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and walked in the holy wayes of Gods Commandements. And many laſt of all in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18609:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the diverſitie of the adjoyned glory; even as in hell (<hi>Luke</hi> 12.47.) be degrees of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For if there bee a difference in torment then alſo a difference in glory, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who by a compariſon taken from the ſtarres, proveth a difference in ſuch as are rayſed to eternall happineſſe. And of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> and many other of the holy fathers, together with the greateſt ſtreame of our moderne Divines (and they prove it cheifly out of <hi>Math.</hi> 10.41. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.47. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.41. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6.) namely that the Saints in heaven have divers degrees of glory, ſome more, ſome leſſe, according to their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of faith and charity, zeale and godlines in this preſent life.</p>
            <p>And in the body naturall there bee likewiſe many parts, ſeverall members and ligaments, of which ſome are more honourable than other: the head above the foote, the eye above the legge, and ſo of the reſt. The one part cannot ſay to the other, <hi>I have no need of thee,</hi> nor thou of mee; For in their functions each one ſerves to helpe anothers need, and are all neceſſary to the mutuall ſuccour and defence of one another. So in the body politicke there muſt be an head, eyes and hands, as well as feete. The wiſe the noble, the noble, the mighty, muſt governe the fooliſh ignorant, and weake, ſuppreſſe the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, and bridle the obſtinate. For thus doth
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18609:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>order maintaine the brittle fabricke of the world from ruine, inlarge heavens happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and take away from man the ſhape of monſter, in ſtead whereof he ſtandeth as the beſt moſt exquiſite, harmonious, and perfect peice of Gods building, for in the viſible world there is nought excells him. And ſhall then the body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke be all feet and no head, it cannot, it may not, it muſt not be. For beſide all this we have heard the Scripture mentioning ſubjection to the higher powers; And wee have heard of a power ſuperiour to the reſt. In which regard the adverſe tenets are nothing worth.</p>
            <p>Nor is it ſecondly, as the conſiſtorian or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Puritane would have it, for <hi>By me Kings reigne,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15. which the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> was taught, not onely in a dreame, but by a voice ſent downe from heaven; namely, that the moſt high ruleth in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of men, and to whomſoever hee will hee giveth it, <hi>Dan</hi> 4.25.32. And ſo alſo elſe-where Kings are plainly ſaid to hold their crownes of God. For I (and not the people, ſaith the Lord,) <hi>have ſaid, yee are Gods,</hi> Pſal. 82.6. <hi>Yee are Gods;</hi>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18609:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>of a lawfull King may be made apparent, to the purblind oppoſites of a crooked genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Howbeit as if climats altered truths, theſe men wil granthim no prerogative but what they pleaſe Will he do they thinke, who hath ſaid, <hi>ye are Gods and children of the higheſt,</hi> be wel pleaſed to ſee the people limit the power of a King to their owne tedder? or hath he ſet up Kings ſo high in place &amp; dignity as that their throns are ſaid to be his, and all this with an intent or purpoſe that the people ſhould curb them? ſurely no: For as a King may do whatſoever hee pleaſeth, ſo none (ſaith the ſcripture) may ſay unto him what doſt thou? <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.3.4. <hi>Si quis é nobis, O rex juſtitiae trami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes tranſcendere voluerit, ate corripi poteſt, ſi vero tu acceſſeris, quis te corripiet?</hi> was that which <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> ſaid once to a King of <hi>France.</hi> And ſo a Lawyer likewiſe of our owne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, a long while ſince, <hi>Omnem eſſe ſub Rege et ipſum ſub nullo, ſed tantum ſub Deo,</hi> meaning that all are under their King, and he under none but God alone.

            <p>Or put the caſe, that in ſome ſuch kingdome as I now mention the loving ſubjects of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie doe ſometimes meet with juſt grievances,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18609:20"/>yet I dare ſay, it is more then the chiefe head of ſuch a place, either knoweth, or intendeth.

For though <hi>righteous lips</hi> (as <hi>Solo non</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, in the ſixteenth chapter of the <hi>Prov rbs</hi> at the thirteenth verſe) <hi>be the delight of Kings, and they love him that ſpeaketh right things.</hi> yet the innocencie and goodneſſe of Princes, doe what they can, may ſometimes be beguiled: And in that when things are thus, they ſuffer ſurely farre enough although they come not likewiſe within the gun-ſhot of their wicked mouths <hi>Who curſe their Father, and doe not bleſſe their Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor ſecondly, is every thing to be taken as a juſt grievance, at which ſome one or other will be ever and anon ready to grudge and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure. For who hath not heard, that in ſtate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires there be many miſteries? And miſteries of ſtate appertaine not to private perſons: What have they to doe to meddle with them; or to whet and repine at that, the intent or end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they know not, <hi>Quae ſupra nos, nihil ad nos.</hi> And therefore they that will (either in publike as much as they dare; or in private as much as they can) kicke and ſpurne at ſuch proceedings and inveigle others to the ſame faction, do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18609:20"/>out queſtion deſerve the heavie wrath of a King, and ſtrict hand of juſtice to bridle their pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh frenzie. For if all things were according to the filth of their fancies who are the heads of this faction, or the chiefe ſticklers in it, there ſhould be neither Eccleſiaſticall nor temporal ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And looke how the old cocks crow, the yong will ſoone learne, the little ſpawne and nibling frie will ſcarce degenerate: For although (before they be well grounded in this rebellious way) they may be ſomewhat better minded than their Captaines; yet by degrees they are like enough to grow up into bigger fiſhes; and ſo the more bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to ſtop the cleere current of a Kings Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and to trouble the faire waters of Church governement. But for matters of the Church I forbeare to ſhew their malice till anone: In the meane time wondring that nothing but a Parity (which breeds an Anarchy) can pleaſe their diſtaſtfull palates. I would to God that they were of another minde, for I am ſorrie to ſee that they ſhould digeſt nothing but what agrees to their factious humors. This argues either a foule or weake ſtomacke, when wholeſome food is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpected. Or if you will beleeue them in their outward ſhewes or owne pretences, they are a queaſie kind of people. But what need is there of words, when deedes are manifeſt? Let them but abate their high minded wills, and they may ſoone informe their weakeneſſe; otherwiſe they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18609:21"/>muſt be curbed as with bit and bridle, leaſt (in their head-ſtrong courſes) they fall at laſt upon their Soveraigne. For before that any of their grounds ſhall bee impugned (as our late King <hi>Iames</hi> of bleſſed memory hath well obſerved) let King,<note place="margin">See the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilicon Doron.</hi> and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monit. to all Chriſtian Monarchs, <hi>Pag.</hi> 45.</note> people, Law, and all be trodden under foote. Meaning, that they care for neither; but thinke it their greateſt honour to contend with Kings, and perturbe whole Kingdomes, calling thoſe miſchiefes by the name of holy warres: and therefore preferre them farre before true loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and obedience; which (as they wickedly tearme it) is in it ſelfe an vngodly peace.</p>
            <p>Theſe then are thoſe ſerpents which have a deſire to ſting, but a power greater then their owne prevailes againſt them, their wiſhes would be actions, were it not that (like curſt Cowes) they finde themſelues hindred in nothing more then in their ſhort hornes. But ſhall a King be our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſhall we ceaſe to honour him? Shal God put the ſword into his hand, and ſhall wee bee ſo ſeditious or diſobedient, as to wreſt it into our owne? Or ſhall a King take care over us that what wee have we may poſſeſſe it in peace, fit every man under his owne Vine and Fig-tree and ſhall we have no care at all to be loving and liberall unto him, but be as blockiſh and chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh as was that fooliſh <hi>Nabal,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>David</hi> ſecured his goods and cattell?<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.7.10.</note>

            <p>The beauty of a crowne to him that weares

To which purpoſe I may recite a ſtorie of a certaine King, mentioned by <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> who when the Diadem or Crowne was brought unto unto him, before he would ſet it upon his head, held it long in his hand, conſidering and looking ſeriouſly upon it; and at the laſt burſt forth into theſe or the like words and ſaid, <hi>O nobilem magis quam foelicem or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum! quem ſi quis penitus cognaſcat quam multis ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And the reaſon ſeemes to bee plaine for he that hath many thouſands of people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his governement, muſt provide that his care be the cauſe of their ſafetie, his labour their reſt, and his troubled thoughts the quiet of their minds: it being with him and his, as with the ſtarres and planets, by whoſe light and motion the world thrives in all the parts both of times and ſeaſons, ſoiles and climates. For as the courſe of nature would ſuffer detriment, if the Heavens
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18609:22"/>ſhould leave their motions; So a Prince cannot be void of care, without the great dammage of his people; whoſe ſtudie is no leſſe to maintaine them in peace, then to defend them both in and from the warres.</p>
            <p>Theſe be then in part thoſe pricking thornes which they have for a counterpoyſe of their brightnes and royal dignities, yea theſe, and ſuch like, are the common calamities that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Scepters, Crownes, and Diademes; whereof a meane eſtate never findeth any taſte.</p>
            <p>To which adde the coſt as well as care, and can yee not then conclude, that he who keeps our tillage muſt have tribute out of our Lands: he that keepes the Sea muſt have cuſtome from thoſe who traffique in and out from thence: And if the walls of ſuch a kingdome want repairing or the channells want ſcouring, the ſubiects muſt ſet to their willing hands to build them up, and make them cleane from the perturbation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſters, theeues and robbers. Which as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth us, is no more but this: We have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God no other walls but Ships: nor Scaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for the ſeas, but ſuch Royall forces.</p>
            <p>And next looke that as by how much the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſucceſſion ſhall more and more appeare in the welcome Stemmes, and royall branches of a Kings increaſe, by ſo much there is the more need of taxe or ſubſidie. For Kings and Princes muſt not live like Peaſants; Neither may Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18609:22"/>live like Princes: And yet (contrarie to all order and decorum) each peaſent among us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be a kind of Prince.

And therefore they do ill to complaine of deare times, when they themſelves are without doubt in this vaine way, maine helpes (although notſole cauſes) to make them ſuch. And herein there is one thing more which I grieve to utter; that hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, charity and means of doing good, ſhould in a manner be quite dead and gone. And why is that, but by reaſon that all is too little to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this their apiſh pride, theſe their fooliſh faſhions, with other as vaine and idle ſpendings, for by how much we are the more in waſt unto

            <p>But to this (perhaps) it may be objected, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
               </label> that the drift or intent of the foreſaid ſpeech was to deterre the people from having a King; and not to ſhew the rights or the Royalties of a King.</p>
            <p>Whereto I anſwer, that the main drift was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to deterre them. <label type="milestone">

               </label> But as there cannot be an effect without a cauſe: ſo that the thing intended might be effected, he ſheweth how farre the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and right of a King, once ſet over them, might extend it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>I ſay might: For it no where appeareth, that <hi>Saul</hi> put in practiſe all theſe things here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. And therefore ſhould it [in the ſecond place] be objected, that <hi>Samuel</hi> deterres them (not by ſhewing the lawfull power of a King but) by declaring the cuſtomes of a Tyrant: it muſt be granted that <hi>Saul</hi> was to be ſuch a one as is there deſcribed; or elſe, in my judgement, they are wide from the matter. <hi>Saul</hi> I grant was tyrannous enough in his cruelties againſt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and bloodie practiſes againſt the Prieſts, formerly mentioned. But, if in caſe of neceſſity, he had beene forced to doe what this ſcripture declareth, I doubt not but he might have done
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18609:24"/>it without the imputation of injuſtice, or of any tyrannous uſurpation. For be it granted, that if the extreamity of this were ordinarily urged by a King, or put in practiſe upon every tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall ſlight occaſion, or without juſt cauſe, it were not better then tyrannie, as wee are taught, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.20. yet on the contrarie, for a King to exerciſe ſuch or the like autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie over his Subjects, when any imminent danger or knowne neceſſity ſhall compell him to it, is no tyrannie, but the toppe and high branch of his regall power, and royall preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. For if not in ſuch caſes, then in what is it that <hi>A King may doe whatſoever he pleaſeth, where his word is there is power,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eceloſ. 8.3.4.</note> 
               <hi>and who may ſay unto him what doſt thou?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And be it granted, that this be not done out of tyrannie but neceſſity, it ſerues not onely for ſafetie, but for tryall alſo of a ſubjects incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or affection towards his Prince. Yea and thus alſo may be ſaid, even when we ſpeake more generally not onely of this, but of all the foreſaid occaſions, comparing one time and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with another.</p>
            <p>Neither do I finde, that there is, or can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time, wherein the head ought not to bee ſtrengthened. For by ſuffering the head to bee weake how can the body proſper? Or if the Kings treaſury be not like a ſpring, how can the waters of ſafetie be conveyed into the Ciſternes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18609:24"/>of his ſubjects? And therefore to bee, as ſome are, ſo much be witched to what wee have, that we had rather looſe all, then part with ſome, argues as well folly as malignity. For, as the Moone and ſtarres would fall infinitely ſhort of that bright luſtre which now they have, if the Sunne were ſtripped of his abundant ſhining; So, take from a King his Royall prerogative, with the Conſiſtorians and their peeviſh adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; ſtint him to the modicums of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>Nabaliſts,</hi> and let him be as if hee were a King and no King; and then his very people will in a ſhort ſpace find, that as from his flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing comes their happineſſe, So from his want comes their miſerie.</p>
            <p>But here (perhaps) will ſome man object, <label type="milestone">

            <p>Nor is it thirdly as the Pope and Puritan-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts would have it: for <hi>Deus transfert regna;</hi> God (and not the Pope) diſpoſeth of Kingdomes <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.21. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.32.

            <p>But I partly know what they have to object: and therefore I anſwer: Firſt, that it was not <hi>Samuel</hi> that ſet up <hi>Saul</hi> no otherwiſe then by the immediate direction of the holy Spirit. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it <hi>Samuel</hi> that depoſed <hi>Saul. Samuel</hi> depoſed him not by any authoritie in himſelfe exiſting; What was done was by the ſpeciall direction of God Almightie, as cannot but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to him who reades the Scripture, in the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Suffer mee</hi> (ſaid <hi>Samuel</hi> to the King) <hi>and I will declare unto thee what the Lord
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18609:26"/>hath ſpoken to mee in the night.</hi> And then forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee delivered his meſſage which God had revealed to him; namely that although he were in his own perſon to enioy the Kingdome as long as hee lived (as by the event of things appeared) yet the Lord had ſo rejected him and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie from being King, that none of his race ſhould have any right of claime, or place of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion ever after, to or in the Crowne.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly,<note place="margin">2. Kin. 11.</note> as for the fact of the high-Prieſt <hi>Ioiada;</hi> it proveth indeed that it is and ever was lawfull for a ſtate or common-weale to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an Uſurper, and reſtore the true heire to his right: but to depoſe any lawfull Prince (be he otherwiſe never ſo exorbitant in life, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and beleife, or cruell in his governement) cannot from thence be proved. For if the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, or chiefe Prieſts, had ever ſuch ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power granted to them, why did they not practiſe it on the perſons of ſundry wicked Kings which ſometimes reigned both in <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael?</hi> it ſeemes they might not, and therefore we find they did not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Samuels</hi> example then proves nothing; for it was by immediate direction. And <hi>Ioiada's</hi> proves as little unleſt it be in the like caſe. For <hi>Athalia</hi> was no lawfull Queen, but an uſurping Tyrant; from whoſe bloodie hands <hi>Ioaſh</hi> the right heire was ſtrangely preſerved by the meanes of his aunt <hi>Ioſaba</hi> the wife of <hi>Ioiada</hi> the Prieſt, who
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18609:27"/>tooke him privily from among the number of the Kings children appointed to be ſlaine, and hid him in the Lords houſe ſixe yeares: Then <hi>Ioiada</hi> brings him forth not as he was Prieſt, but rather as a Guardian and Protectour, having married the ſiſter of the former King, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him to the people like a good and loyall ſubject, that thereby the crowne might bee ſet upon the right head, and the Scepter taken from an uſurping Tyrant.</p>
            <p>If therefore the Pope can ſhew more for himſelfe, then in plaine truth can be ſhewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, let him take all that he claimeth, and we on our ſide will freely acknowledge that we have done him wrong.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18609:30"/>that therefore none of the Clergie ought to be obedient to the civill Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>In which tenets and practiſes, both he and his fellowes did not onely tranſgreſſe the truth pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught, maintained, and practiſed in the firſt times of the Goſpell; but alſo went contrary to the ancient times of thoſe many godly Prophets and Prieſts under the Law: witneſſe in the Court of the Iewes, one for all; even <hi>Nathan,</hi> who when he came before the King made his obeyſance, called him his Lord, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged himſelfe a ſubject, or ſervant to him,<note place="margin">1 Kin. 1.24.</note> as it is in the 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 1.24.

                  <p>As for the firſt, thus it was: The Apoſtles did not ordaine the difference; They onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded as Chriſt had ordained. For as there were chiefe and inferiour Prieſts in the times before Chriſt: in like manner, at the firſt preaching of the Goſpell the foundation of the Church was ſo laid, that all Prieſts were not in all things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, for the twelue Apoſtles were firſt called and ſent;<note place="margin">See Mat. 10. and Luk. ch. 2.8. 10. ver. 3.</note> Then after them the ſeventie Diſciples; Chriſt likened the firſt to ſheepe; the ſecond to lambes: thereby declaring, that there was a greater dignity in the one then in the other: and that the firſt-ſent, had not onely the priority of time, but of place and authoritie. It was Chriſts owne act: and therefore let no man preſume not ſo much as to thinke of joyning together thoſe whom Chriſt hath put aſunder.

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in theſe ordinances, it is as if Chriſt tooke patterne from the Law, (wherein all Prieſts were not equall;) yet is it nothing againſt the abrogation of the Law. For the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies both might be and were aboliſhed, although the forme of the old governement bee ſtill retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſeeing that was a thing which pertained not ſo much to types and figures, as to that <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18609:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>might ordaine Biſhops, conſtitute Churches, and elect Clergie men by lots, whom the Holy Ghoſt had aſſigned: and comming to a City not farre of, he caſt his eyes upon that Biſhop which was ſet over all the reſt, and unto him hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the tuition of a young Gentleman, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I doe earneſtly commend this young man unto thee, witneſſe Chriſt and his Church.</p>
                  <p>Nay, before this alledged of theſe Apoſtles, we read in ſcripture of <hi>Philip,</hi> one of the ſeven Deacons, who being ſent forth an Evangeliſt, preached and baptized; but neither might, nor did ordaine others to doe the like: For when the Apoſtles heard that <hi>Samaria</hi> had received the word of God, they ſend thither <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> becauſe they had power of impoſition of hands which <hi>Philip</hi> had not as is recorded in the eight chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles.<note place="margin">Act. 8.14.17.</note> Nor did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> but ſet downe rules how Biſhops ſhould behave themſelves, which were in vaine if the Church ought of right to bee without them.</p>
                  <p>But among all paſſages, this may not ſlip; namely, that the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſiae,</hi> had their Biſhops, even at the very time when the Spirit of God endeavoured to lay open the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of their faults: And yet amongſt all the things worthy of blame wherewith they were charged, there is not a word againſt them for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing governed by Biſhops, and ſurely, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18609:40"/>had not eſcaped reprehenſion, if it had not beene knowne to have beene of divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                  <p>And next (the teſtimonies being thus cleare) can any but a mad-man thinke, that they are meant only of ordinary Pariſh Prieſts, ſuch as are now; as if every ſuch Prieſt ſhould bee a Biſhop? Or if of other Biſhops, is there any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for it, that they ſhould be Biſhops onely in title without juriſdiction, when one (as we ſee) is plainly ſaid to have the governement of many Churches, which by the Apoſtles were founded, planted, conſtituted, or appointed? Certainly the word Churches in the plurall number, doth not import more Catholike Churches then one for there is but one, and therfore by Churches is meant the ſeverall plantation of Churches to be ſetled and governed by their Biſhops: ſome one having the cheife overſight of as many as were within the bounds of one precinct, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of as many as were within the bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of another precinct.

                  <p>Thus were the firſt beginnings: The imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, continuations and inlargements, were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and built upon the ſame grounds, when as the number of beleevers increaſed there was a more generall diviſion of Congregations into a greater number of particular pariſhes: Yet ſo as they were to have their dependance on the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches firſt erected, and to be governed by every ſuch Biſhop as was the Biſhop of their bounds and limits: yea, and alſo, according to the ſaid increaſe or growth of Churches, and conſequently of Dioceſſes, it was held agreeable to the divine inſtitution of this order, to have not onely Arch-biſhops, as well as Biſhops, but Patriarchs as well as either of both, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all things might be the better ordered in the Church of God.

                     </label> ſome light concerning thoſe officers belonging to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which wee call by the name of Sworne-men, Gardians, or wardens of the Church, into whoſe hands the care of Church proviſions is committed, both in the providing of things wanting, in repayring of things decayed, and in the truſtie keeping of things had. Theſe are thoſe men who preſent to the Arch-biſhop, Biſhop, Arch-deacon, or their Chancellours, the faults and diſorders done in their pariſh againſt thoſe Articles to which they are ſworne, againſt the Canons, and againſt his Majeſties Lawes Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. and ſo the Arch-biſhoppe, Biſhoppe, Arch-deacon, or their officers, proceed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the information of the ſaid Wardens of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18609:46"/>every ſuch Pariſh. For albeit the love of monie, rather then of vertue and reformation, bee ready (among ſome under-officers) to ſend out the Apparatour as a cloſe ſpie, into the Countrey; yet we know that the Canons of our Church doe in no wiſe tollerate ſuch indirect courſes. Whereupon, in the 138. Canon, thus wee read; that <hi>They</hi> (meaning Aparatours) <hi>ſhall not take upon them the office of Promoters or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers for the Court.</hi> Which in ſome ſort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth alſo to that of Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaying; that there is nothing done in the Church without thoſe Elders of which hee ſpeaketh: becauſe ſuch diſorders as are proceeded againſt, according to the tenour of their informations, are legally proceeded againſt, and juſtly puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; there being an oath taken for the diſcharge of this office in a pious and conſcionable way.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is with us; And thus alſo (or not far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe) it was in the dayes of old; S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> complained of the want of it, and we doe well to retaine ſtill theſe uſefull footings appertaining to it.</p>
                  <p>Onely ſometimes we have a double fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: The one in the choiſe of thoſe annual offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; The other in that too high prerogative which ſome men give them above their Miniſter.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, in many country pariſhes, the loweſt &amp; meaneſt of the people are choſen although they be but yong and ignorant boies in compariſon of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18609:46"/>others: whereas they ought of right to be grave, ſober, and able Seniors (if not for yeeres yet for parts) who both know their office, and are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to do it. And yet be they whom they will, either in this office for the Church, or in that of Conſtable for the common-weale, if they would or could but tell how to make conſcience of an oath, there would not come in ſo many <hi>omnia be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne's,</hi> when there be <hi>Multa paſsim mala.</hi> Howbeit I do not mention this to incourage the envious bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie practiſes of ſome ill diſpoſed officers, but only to ſtir up the negligent to a more carefull conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the wrong done to themſelves, through their ſlight regarding of knowne evills.</p>
                  <p>And next as for that exaltation which ſome men give them, tis fit they have all that of right belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to them: but to be exalted above their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, is more then can, may, or ought to be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The ſubordination reſts in them, and not in him; at whoſe hand I dare ſay they ought to bee alwaies ready to do, and to take advice as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall require. For although no private Paſtor be a Prelate, yet I take it to be without doubt, that hee is a kind of Rectour in his owne Pariſh by way of reference to the higher powers; and not to bee a meere cypher among his people. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> I ſuppoſe knew it well enough, in the ſubordination before mentioned. And yet, now adayes, there is a generation to be found, who would bee very glad (for the diſreſpect
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18609:47"/>they beare to the Clergie) to ſee the Church-wardens made ſuperiour to their Prieſt, and he to be but a dull ſpectator in all matter of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ſtand with his finger in his mouth, and not dare to meddle with any thing, but be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed, over-topped, and not ſuffered to beare any ſway at all; whilſt they goe on as they liſt, and rule all the roſt, as the common proverbe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. 'Tis ſure that ſuch a generation there is: But I dare not be he that ſhould maintaine ſuch doctrine for good divinitie: for if it be not (in them that doe) a tricke to pleaſe the people, or a ſowing of pillowes under their Elbowes, I am certainly much deceived. But let them tell me if they can (for I would bee glad to know it) what Canon in our Church, or Rubricke in our Liturgy, will ſerve any whit to countenance ſuch a proud and ambitious faction. The 113. canon giveth Miniſters power to preſent, for feare if all ſhould be left to the Churchwardens there would be nothing done to rectifie things amiſſe. The 89. canon makes it lawfull for the Miniſter to chooſe one of the Churchwardens and ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and to take notice of their accounts. The 91. cannon alowes him (and not the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens) to niake choice of the Pariſh clerke. Alſo he (&amp; not the Churchwardens) is<note n="a" place="margin">Can. 26. &amp; Rubr. before Communion</note> allowed to be a judge betweene two offenders, and whom he findes to be obſtinare in malice, not to admit him (but the other) to the holy Communion. It
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18609:47"/>is alſo left to his<note n="b" place="margin">Rubr. after the Commu.</note> diſcretion to judge whether the number bee ſufficient to bee adminiſtred unto. Alſo the Churchwardens<note n="c" place="margin">Can. 20 and Rubrick after the Commu.</note> are to take advice from him (and not he from them) recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his direction for the providing of Bread and Wine for Communions.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the time for baptizing of children (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Morning, or in the Afternoone) is<note n="d" place="margin">Rubr. before publick Bapt.</note> left to his diſcretion. It is likewiſe left to his diſcretion to determine whether the<note n="e" place="margin">Rubr. before private Bapt.</note> excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes alledged by Parents for not bringing their children to holy Baptiſme, on the next Sunday or Holy-day after they bee borne, bee juſt and reaſonable. Alſo if he ſhall perceive any to come to the Font (who never received the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) to anſwer for a child, hee ſhall not<note n="f" place="margin">Can. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

He is alſo to have a key of the almes-box and other cheſt: and to be imployed in taking a Terrier of Glebe lands, and other poſſeſſions belonging to the Church: For which ſee canon 84 70. and 87. And againe by vertue of the 88. cannon he may either forbid the ringing of Bells, or give leave to have them rung, as he thinketh fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, where though the Church wardens (as in ſome other things be alſo mentioned; yet ſure we find it not, The Churchwardens and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18609:48"/>but the Miniſter and the Churchwardens; Hee in the firſt place, they in the next. So that now it well appeareth, that every Miniſter is more then a dull ſpectator in his pariſh for the ordering and diſpoſing of things there, and that the Churchwardens are ſo farre from being ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to their Miniſter, as that they be his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants rather, and at his command in the abſence of the ordinary, to whom they are bound to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that which cannot bee amended or orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red otherwiſe: for there be indeed thoſe courts to which offenders muſt bee cited, and from whence the cenſure for their faults muſt be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>But I haſten: for all hitherto is plaine enough eſpecially againſt thoſe who would have the Church governement committed to the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or if to the Prieſts, in a confuſed parity.</p>
                  <p>Neither (laſt of all) ſhall I neede to ſpeake much of ſome others, who whilſt they decline the name of Biſhop, retaine the office under other names: which they doe (I dare ſay) in hatred of tyrannicall proud papall Biſhops: For what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther colour can they have? But (alas) what harme is there in the name, ſeeing the Tyrannie reſteth not in the name, but in the perſon; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe every King ſhould be no better then a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, becauſe <hi>Tarquin,</hi> and many other Kings haue uſed Tyrannie. The Hierarchie of Biſhops is as ancient (you ſee) as Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18609:48"/>The inſtitution was not Apoſtolicall, but divine in a more high alloy: Chriſt firſt founded it, and the Apoſtles tooke it up from him, in their adminiſtration of the publique governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo it deſcended to the ſucceeding times of all ages, as formerly hath beene ſhewed. And therfore to be ſtubborne, diſobedient, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, or diſ-reſpective towards it, is to fight againſt Gods ordinance, to trouble the peace of the Church with fond fiery factions, and to joyn with that generation, who <hi>curſe their Father, and doe not bleſſe their Mother.</hi>

               <p>And herein five things are conſiderable. Firſt that the people have a reverent reſpect toward the perſons of ſuch as are Miniſters. Secondly, that they diſdaine not to heare their Preachings, Rebukes, and Exhortations. Thirdly, that they obey both Doctrine, and Diſcipline,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18609:49"/>conforming themſelves to the orders, rites, or ceremonies of the Church under which they live. Fourthly, that they be peaceable towards them. Fiftly, that they robbe them not, but render to them their true and juſt dues out of all their goods.</p>

                  <p>AND why I begin firſt with this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the people are bound to ſhew a reverent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect toward the very perſon of a Miniſter; is not becauſe their perſons are more honourable then their doctrine; but becauſe their doctrine cannot profit, where their perſons are deſpiſed. <hi>Cujus perſona deſpicitur, ejus doctrina contemnitur,</hi> ſayth Saint <hi>Bernard.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bern. Serm. <hi>2.</hi> dereſur. Demini.</note> And the reaſon is plaine; for whil'ſt men are ſo wicked as to ſlight, mocke, contemne, and deſpiſe our perſons, they forget that we are the Ambaſſadours of Chriſt; and forgetting this, the meſſage likewiſe will bee thought our owne, and none of Gods. Men will forget that Gods authoritie ſhineth in us; and ſo the meſſage be ſet at nought, as well as he that brings it. Which whil'ſt the Devill percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, he helpeth the world forward what he can, in this deſperate miſchiefe; caſting a black thick foggie cloud, before the bright beautie of their glittering feet, who are ſent to bring the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of good things, to a wicked and ill-deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18609:49"/>people. Wherefore in the ſecond Councell of <hi>Matiſcon</hi> (<hi>Canon</hi> 15.) it was ſtrictly ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that all ſecular men ſhould doe reverence to the Clergie, even to the loweſt degree of them. wherſoever they met them.

Loth (I ſay) to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their actions, leaſt the Chriſtians bluſh at their owne pride, which ſteales away ſo greedily the honour of their Prieſts; thinking all too little
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18609:50"/>which is given to themſelves, all too much which is given to them. But if they bluſh, it is a ſigne of Grace (I hope) as well as guiltineſſe. And therefore whil'ſt the knowledge may be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; let them all know, that by that light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is left ſtill in the ſoules of men, and by which the very Heathens have judged, that either a God, or gods ought to be worſhiped; they have eſteemed their Prieſts worthie of no meane honour, reverence, and obſervation: And better is it to learne from theſe men now, then that hereafter they riſe up in judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you.

                  <p>Out of which Seripture (ſeeing the Apoſtle ſpeakes ſo generally) 'tis eaſie to learne, that in caſe the Heralds booke (as ſome have ſcornfully objected) ſhould either denie, or be ſparing of civill honour, to thoſe of our Tribe, who are not able to derive their pedigree from renowned Aunceſtours. Gods booke is of uſe to ſupply even that defect; for we ſee that the booke of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18609:52"/>God neither denieth, nor is ſparing of any ſuch thing to us; but would have us knowne with reſpect, and not meanely eſteemed, but bee of high account in regard of that office whereunto we are called.

                  <p>The people alſo were numbred by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Eleazar</hi> in the plaine of <hi>Moab;</hi> as they had been numbred formerly by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in the wilderneſſe of <hi>Sinai, Numb.</hi> 26.63.64.</p>
                  <p>From which teſtimonies it is plaine and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that ſome ſuch Prieſts as the King thinks fit, may (when he pleaſeth) be lawfully employed in civill affaires or offices; and may even thus be honoured, as were thoſe Prieſts of old.</p>
                  <p>And whereas ſome object, that arguments drawne from the old. Teſtament,<note place="margin">An objection anſwered.</note> prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now under the New: it is anſwered. Firſt, that they may as well deny the arguments taken from thence againſt the Popes authority, and domineering power over Chriſtian Kings, and Princes, as denie theſe arguments, for proofe of that civill honour which is thus
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18609:55"/>given to the Miniſters of the Goſpell. And therefore it is not love, but envie, which would ſeeme to bolſter out things with ſuch new Divinitie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Miniſters of the Goſpell (as one hath well obſerved) may with more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience be employed in civill offices, then thoſe Prieſts under the Law; whoſe time is not now taken up (as then it was) with attendance on the daily ſacrifices; great number of feaſts, ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and ſuch like occaſions, by which their leiſure was leſſe to heare civill matters, then now to the Miniſter under the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Miniſters of the Goſpell have ſucceeded in a place of the Levites, and looke what in that kinde was lawfull for them to doe, is not unlawfull now, eſpecially ſeeing theſe employments pertained not to things typicall, figurative, or ceremoniall. And fourthly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Chriſt and his Apoſtles were never thus employed, yet is that nothing againſt our tenet: For <hi>who made me a judge over you,</hi> ſayth Chriſt? Intimating,<note place="margin">Luke 12.14.</note> that unleſſe the ſupreame Magiſtrate ſhall aſſigne Clergie-men to ſuch offices, they may not meddle with them. But had the Church and Common-wealth been both one, then it had beene as lawfull as in the daies of old; which appointment or aſſignation was never like to bee, ſo long as the Church was in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heathen tyrants.</p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:18609:55"/>
                  <p>Certain it is, that when the Emperours became Chriſtians, ſome men of the Church were thus employed. And although the condition of the Miniſters of Chriſt, differed not in this from that of the Levites, yet it could not ſhew it ſelfe till then. Examples are not wanting.<note place="margin">Theod. lib. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>30.</hi>

                  <p>Neither can this bee called an inuaſion of the offices of the civill Magiſtrate, or be contrary to the rule of any auncient Canon, when it is done by the conſent and appointment of the chiefe Magiſtrate; as in the lawes of <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> (alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Saravia</hi>) is apparent.<note place="margin">Lib. de honore Praſulibus et Preſbyt. debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. cap. <hi>20.</hi>

                  <p>Fiftly, and laſtly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> thought it lawfull to ſpend his ſpare time in the worke of his hands: But if the neceſſitie of Domeſticke affaires may excuſe a Paſtour of the Church for ſo doing; then much more may they be excuſed for doing ſuch offices (when the King thinkes it fit that they bee called thereunto) as ſhall benefit the common wealth wherein they live.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth this appertaine to the entangling of our ſelves with the things of this World. For that text where this is mentioned; ſtriketh at thoſe whoſe covetous hands and greedie hearts are ſo glewed to the earth, for the gathering to themſelves a private eſtate, that they forget every ſuch thing as may tend to the good, either of the Church, or State wherein they live; which every good Chriſtian, and therefore every upright man of God will be carefull to avoid.</p>
                  <p>Nor againe, doth that of our Saviour [in <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25.] denie the titles of civill honours to men of the Church. Titles of civill honour are not their denied; for it doth not (as ſhall appeare) forbid honour and authority, or the titles thereunto belonging: but ambitious ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, or them; together with that tyrannicall uſing of it, which the wicked kings of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, through the conceit of their owne great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſoothings of their flatterers proudly take upon them.</p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:18609:56"/>
                  <p>And that this is the meaning of that Text, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe Chriſt acknowledged that the title <hi>Rabbi</hi> (which ſignifieth a Maſter, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable perſon, or a man that is eminent by reaſon of his many dignities and places of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that he holdeth) was a title of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him: Hee diſclaimed it not, but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it. <hi>Ye call mee Maſter, and Lord, and ye ſay well, for ſo I am.</hi> Iohn 13.13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt was called Maſter, and not refuſed it. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.12.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, although Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
                     <note n="(*)" place="margin">Act. 14.15.</note> denied to be worſhipped with Divine honour; yet when <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were reverenced with civill honour, and called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE next thing that followeth, is, That the people give eare, and come where they may heare the Doctrines, rebukes, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of their ghoſtly Fathers. For though they be men whom the Lord hath aſſigned to this holy office: yet men, to whom hee hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed a peculiar grace,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.6. <hi>ibid.</hi>

It came to thoſe of Chriſts ſchoole, from Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; but was not to end with them, for there is a * building which cannot be perfected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: And being therefore appointed for it,<note place="margin">Epheſ 4.12.

                     </note> it hath beene conveighed ever ſince by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands, to ſuch as are not otherwiſe any lawfull Prieſts of God. And finally, that care may be had in the conveighance hereof; It is the counſell of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.22.</note>

                  <p>Thus then we have it, and are by this meanes become perſons ſacred, and have authoritie to deale in holy things. We bleſſe in the name of him that bleſſeth: The diſpenſation of the Word and Sacraments is committed to us; We have power to binde,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.18. 2 Cor. 5.20.</note> wee have power to looſe, wee are Ambaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us.</p>
                  <p>The meſſage is from Heaven, as delivering to you God's bleſſed will, out of his holy Word: And therefore to be received,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 2.13</note> not as the word of men, but as the Word of God. So that as we, if we love the Lord,<note place="margin">Ioh. 21.15.16</note> will feede his Lambes, and Sheepe: In like manner ye, if ye deſpiſe not Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luke 21.16.

                  <p>For this he doth, hee ſpeaketh by us, though not by immediate inſpiration (as ſome phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtickes fondly dreame;) yet by our rightly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Word of truth, which is properly and indeed the Word of God:<note place="margin">Aug. cont.

                     <hi>In cujus praedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ſpiritus Sanctus operatur,</hi> as Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſpeaketh. So that though our Sermons ought to have no greater credit, then they can gaine unto themſelves by their agreement with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet not diſſenting from them, they are truely and indeed the Truth and Doctrine of God, and though not his Word by immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration; yet the Word of God, in a ſecundarie
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18609:58"/>ſence; as being the ſober explication, and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſome ſuch part or portion of the Word as we then pitch upon. In which regard, the Preachers of it are Co-workers, or jont-labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers with God, as even the Apoſtles were: For though we cannot bee compared with them in worthineſſe of grace and vertue; yet in likeneſſe of office and Miniſterie, we may, and muſt. And indeed tis a perpetuall Sanction,<note place="margin">Mal. 2.7.</note> that the Prieſts lippes are to preſerve knowledge, and that the people ſeeke the Law at their mouthes; for even in this they are the meſſengers of the Lord of Hoſts. So that in what way ſo ever they convey or give notification of the object of faith (which is the Word) unto the people, whether it be by reading, or otherwiſe; it is to be of more eſteem, then when tis done by any other. Which I doe not note to deterre Lay-people from reading of the Scripture, but to ſhew the difference that is betweene their reading, and ours; as alſo to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that no Scripture is of private interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.20.</note> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath declared.</p>
                  <p>And now to the amplifying of all this, thus I proceed.</p>
                  <p>The Lord's Day [or Sunday] is God's chiefe Schoole-day, wherein God's people muſt come to the Church, for that's his Schoole-houſe; wherein (among other duties to bee done) they muſt heare his Word, for that's their leſſon.</p>
                  <p>Some be Truants, and care not for comming.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18609:59"/>Others be Recuſants, and may not come to joyn themſelves with us. A third ſort be Schiſmaticks, and will not come, except where they affect, and when they pleaſe. And laſt of all, others be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and will ſometimes come; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the end, their comming and hearing is in vaine, they are yet in their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſpeake of theſe in their order: Of the <hi>time,</hi> the <hi>place,</hi> the <hi>perſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. And as for the chiefe time, I call it (as I ought) the Lord's Day, or Sunday; becauſe the Sabbath as ceremoniall, was aboliſhed at the death of Chriſt; as in the ſecond Chapter to the <hi>Colloſſians</hi> is declared.</p>
                  <p>And why a day muſt be ſtill obſerved, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard of what is morall in the fourth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: For it is abſolutely and directly of the Law of Nature, that ſome time be ſet apart, for the publique worſhippe, and ſolemne ſervices of God. And why one day in ſeven, is not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of what is ſtrictly morall, in reſpect of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dictating; but in reſpect of Nature infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Divine inſtruction of the God of Heaven. For whereas Nature knew not how to make choice, or put a difference betweene one <hi>number,</hi> and <hi>another,</hi> it pleaſed God to inſtruct and informe Nature; that thereby that which is not ſtrictly morall <hi>ratione naturae,</hi> might bee knowne and accounted as morall <hi>ratione diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinae:</hi> of which condition, is the <hi>quota pars.</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:18609:59"/>both for Tythes, and for the time of God's pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique worſhippe.</p>
                  <p>And next, why this part of <hi>one</hi> in <hi>ſeven,</hi> hath (ſince the ceaſing of the Sabbath) beene obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by us rathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ron the firſt, then ſecond, third, or any other day of the weeke; is, not in regard of any precept expreſſely commanding it; but in regard of the Churches practice at all times, and in all Ages ever ſince.</p>
                  <p>Now they that began it, were the Apoſtles; being led thereunto by our (and their) Lords reſurrection, and by his often apparitions to them upon that very day, rather then upon any other day beſide: For, as they knew the Sabbath to be aboliſhed by Chriſts death; In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by his reſurrection they had ground ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to direct them to the choice of a peculiar day, for the obſervation of a new and chiefe Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivall; and ſo much the rather, becauſe Chriſt uſed then (as I ſayd) to appeare unto them.</p>
                  <p>Hence therefore it is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Revel. 1.10.</hi> Ignat. epiſt. ad Magneſ.</note> that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> makes mention of a Day, which he calleth <hi>Dies Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> the Lord's Day: And <hi>Ignatius</hi> (one of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples) telleth us, that it was the firſt day of the weeke; the very <hi>Queene and chiefe of Dayes, renowned by our Lord's reſurrection.</hi> So alſo ſayth Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi>

                     <hi>the Lord's Day was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to Chriſtians by the reſurrection of the Lord; and from that time began to be celebraeted.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus they and their ſucceſſours firſt tooke it up. <hi>Apoſtoli &amp; Apoſtolici viri:</hi> This was their ground; and from them to us the obſervation thereof hath proceeded, and is ſtill retained in the Chriſtian Church.</p>

                     <hi>did then ariſe.</hi> Neither was it knowne to have ſo much as the name of Sabbath ever after in the Church of God, without ſome diſtinction added, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from that of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> For in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and litterall ſence, it cannot bee called the Sabbath Day, as being neither that day which the <hi>Iewes</hi> obſerved, nor of ſuch ſtrickt reſt as was that Day of theirs.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the very ſtricktneſſe of their reſt, gave the name of Sabbath to the Day which they
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18609:60"/>were to keepe; but was not the principall thing wherein the ſanctification of it conſiſted. For though the reſt was ſtrictly exacted, yet but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally annexed: and therefore now removed in the removall of that yoke of outward obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, which for the time was laid upon them.<note place="margin">Gala. 4.</note> For as the effect abideth ſo long as the cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, but periſheth when the cauſe ceaſeth; ſo the ſtrictneſſe of Reſt, was to remaine ſo long as the Day and memo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y of the things vailed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſtrict reſt thereof abided. But the Day being taken away, the end and reaſon of the ſayd Reſt is gone, and alſo the ſtrict Reſt it ſelfe; which being figurative, could not be too ſtrict. For the more exact the figure is, the better it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth; as in the Lambe for the Paſſeover well appeareth, which was to be alwaies ſuch, as had no blemiſh.</p>
                  <p>And that this Reſt of theirs thus ſtrictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, was but accidentally annexed; will be manifeſt: if we conſider the many cauſes, more then the chiefe and principall, for which they were to keepe it. For though ſuch a Reſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies requiſite, as may promote the divine du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of God's publique worſhip; and not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the obſervance of that precept which requires the performance of them. Yet if there be other ends beyond that which the ſolemne ſervice of God requireth; thoſe ends muſt bee examined whether they be connected, with that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18609:61"/>end which participates with the moralitie of that Commandement, which leades us to the ſetting apart of ſome time, for God's publique and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ſervice. We denie nothing to be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, which is as a meanes requiſite to that end, for which a Day is ſet apart. But if in the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> reſt there were things figurative; and to ſignifie ſomething which was either paſt, preſent, or then to come: We are nothing bound either to the name of their day, to the day it ſelfe; or to the ſtrict obſervance of ſuch a reſt, as that day of theirs required. For if this be not granted, wee retaine not onely the ſubſtance, but ceremonie likewiſe of the Sabbath: their many ends of reſt, beſide that for which the day was chiefely ſet apart, muſt needes be the cauſe of an extreame ſtrickneſſe: But being to ſignifie, as aforeſayd; it was to them, and not to us, that God intended ſuch a Reſt.</p>
                  <p>For firſt they reſted in memorie of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which on that particular day was ended, ſixe dayes being ſpent in Creating,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.11.</note> before that day of Reſt approached. From the memorie of which (after the manner that they remembred it) we are now called; in regard that the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the day it ſelfe is ceaſed. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16.17. Not that we doe hereby deny God to bee our Creatour, but acknowledge Chriſt to be our Redeemer. And indeed the benefit of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being greater then that of Creation; the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18609:61"/>memorie of the firſt, is obſcured by the laſt, and ſo the one is to give place unto the other; as in a caſe not much unlike it, the Prophet <hi>Ierem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e</hi> hath declared. <hi>Ier.</hi> 16.14 15.</p>
                  <p>Nor againe, doth this laſt impoſe a like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration with the former, in regard of Reſt; becauſe our Saviour did not ſo much reſt upon that day whereon he aroſe, as valiantly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the powers of death. It may be rather ſaid that he reſted before whil'ſt he lay in the Grave; and ſo they who are dead, bee ſayd to reſt from their labours: but to riſe againe, implyes a breaking off from reſt, and a beginning of labour, which even in this cannot but be granted; if the conſideration be taken up, with relation to that reſt which went before it, whil'ſt the bodie lay in the quiet Grave till the time appointed. Nor doe I thinke it ſtrange to ſay, that on our Day of the Lord, the memorie of the Redemption be come in place of that of Creation. For tho we have the proper ſolemnitie of Chriſt's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, upon that day which is called <hi>Eaſter;</hi> yet this weekely day of publique worſhip, being (as Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſpeaketh) conſecrated to us by our Lords Reſurrection; doth not onely deſerve to be made choice of, for the peculiar day of our ſolemne Aſſemblies, but to be judged alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in ſome ſort to the benefit of Redemption.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, their ſtrict reſting was a memoriall of their deliverance from the hard labours which
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18609:62"/>they had lately ſuffered in the Land of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> as is expreſſely mentioned in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.15. Now this was a thing peculiarly belonging unto them, and not to us: Therefore they, and we are not both bound to one and the ſame ſtrictneſſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe their condition and ours were both alike.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Ezek. 20 12.</note> this their Sabbath was given them for a ſigne,<note place="margin">Pſal. 147.20.</note> that God had then choſen them from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Nations of the earth, to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: For the Heathen had no knowledge of his Lawes; but they had: the partition wall was then unbroken. In token of which favour they had the Sabbath, which they were ſtrictly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; not doing their owne will, nor ſpeaking ſo much as their owne words, as in theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is declared. <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.13. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.12. and <hi>Eſa.</hi> 58.13.</p>
                  <p>And albeit all Chriſtians now be likewiſe the people of God; yet becauſe they are of more Nations then one, and live in times of more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitie; they are not tyed to ſuch a ſtrict yoake, as if they were ſtill in the dayes of the Law, but differenced from that Heire, who whil'ſt he is a Child, muſt live as a ſervant, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Gala.</hi> 4.1. For when the fulneſſe of time was come; the condition of God's people was altered, as at the fift verſe of the foreſayd Chapter is declared. And at the ſeventh verſe, thus; <hi>Thou art no more a ſervant, but a Sonne.</hi> And therefore though bound to bee obedient;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18609:62"/>yet freed from thoſe hard taskes, which of old were ſtrictly required from the Jewiſh people.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, their Sabbath was a type whereby was prefigured that Reſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.4.</note> which (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, and of which their <hi>Canaaen</hi> likewiſe was a figure) remained for the people of God, to be purchaſed for them by Chriſt: who being come, and gone into his Fathers houſe,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.2.</note> wherein <hi>are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manſion places,</hi> went to prepare them; as was prefigured in the foreſaid Reſt of the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. And therefore, ſeeing Chriſt hath actually purchaſed, that which was then prefigured, it were injurious to Chriſt to lay the ſame yoake ſtill upon our neckes.</p>
                  <p>Yea in a word, by what hath beene ſaid, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but appeare, that although our Lord's Day or Sunday, hath of late yeares beene vulgarly knowne and called by the name of the Sabbath; yet of right, neither the name, nor manner of keeping it, appertaines thereunto: For there is ſo great a difference betweene the old Sabbath and our Sunday, that it is a manifeſt miſtake to urge thoſe Scriptures upon us, which peculiarly belonged to them in the obſervation of their Day.</p>
                  <p>But if the Sunday be no Sabbath, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                     </label> why then doth the Church in her Liturgie retaine ſtill the fourth Commandement, and ſay; <hi>Remember that thou keepe holy the Sabbath day, &amp;c.</hi> yea and why are the people bound to pray at the end thereof,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18609:63"/>
                     <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keepe this Law?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For anſwer whereunto,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> this is firſt; that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all the other Commandements are to be kept, <hi>ut ſonant,</hi> according to the letter, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> ſpeaketh: yet this of the Sabbath is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde; being partly morall, partly ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall. And if ſo, then in part it is aboliſhed, and in part retained. And being but in part aboliſhed, it muſt upon neceſſity have ſtill a place among the other precepts. For ſo farre as 'tis morall, 'tis ſtill of force; and is therefore put among the Precepts of the Decalogue for that which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in it. For (as I ſaid formerly) it proceedeth from the Law of Nature, that ſome time be ſet apart for Gods publicke ſervice. And therefore this being revived in the Law of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, ought to be remembred and kept upon one day in ſeven: which laſt, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne till Nature was informed, is now to be reckoned as that principal portion of time which God requireth. And ſo laſt of all, being bound to the morality of the precept, there is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that we pray to have the Lord incline our hearts to the keeping of it: for being ſtrengthned by his aſſiſtance, there will be care had, that we decline not away from the obſervation thereof.</p>
                  <p>And whereas I formerly gave notice, that it is the very chiefe of Dayes; or (as I then expreſſed it) Gods chiefe Schoole-day, I had reaſon for it:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18609:63"/>becauſe there is no Holy Day, which the Church hath appointed to be kept, of ſuch eminency and excellency as is this Day of the Lord; according to that of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in his 251 Sermon <hi>De tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore,</hi> at the very beginning therof, in theſe words, ſaying: <hi>Sciendum eſt (Fratres chariſsimi) quod ideo à ſanctis patribus noſtris conſtitutum eſt chriſtianis, &amp; mandatum, ut in ſolennitatibus Sanctorum, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime in Dominicis diebus, otium haberent, &amp; à ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reno negotio vacarent, ut paratiores &amp; promptiores eſſent ad divinum cultum.</hi> In which words appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, not only the excellency of this Day above other Feſtivalls; but the neceſſity alſo of ſuch a Reſt, as may be no hindrance, but a furtherance to Gods publicke worſhip. For ſuch a Reſt as this, is as a means requiſite for that end for which the Day is ſet apart. The ancient Sabbath had (as hath beene ſhewed) other ends, which here in this Day can take no place, becauſe the Day it ſelfe is now aboliſhed and gone, and the armes of the Church extended further then to one only Nation. All that can be added more, is this; Nature requireth ſome refreſhment, &amp; Religion teacheth us to be mercifull to our very Beaſts;<note place="margin">Prov. 12.10. Deut. 5.14.</note> and if to them, much more to our ſervants: In which regard the other parts of the Day (and ſo the whole Day) are fitly freed from all ſervile labours, except in urgent caſes of extreame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; which alſo makes it not unlawfull, to take in hand ſome harmleſſe recreation for refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18609:64"/>after the ends of all Divine-ſervices in the publike aſſemblies. For when all the publike du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Day be ended, then is that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed for which the day is chiefly ſet apart.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe this cannot be done without Reſt, there is a ceſſation from ordinary labours, both before, and at the times of publike worſhip. Before, for preparation; that thereby we bring not with us <hi>Cor fatui,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.1. Exod. 3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>A fooles heart,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh: but be fitted aforehand for the ſacred employments to which we are going. And at the times likewiſe; becauſe the one cannot be done without the other: that is, our owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate buſineſſes, and the generall and publike du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of piety and devotion, cannot be followed both at once.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the Reſt alſo of the Day points at mercy as well as ſacrifice, (of which there is ſomething ſpoken in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.14.) harmleſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, which is a meanes of refreſhment, claimes her priviledge; and ſteps in at the laſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the publike ſervices for the Day be ended: yea, and as the caſe with ſome may at ſometimes ſtand, is not ſo long denied them; no, not ſo long as then.</p>
                  <p>But ſome ſingular priviledge is not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as a generall practice. And therefore, as it is both a pious and prudent conſtitution of the Church,<note place="margin">Can. <hi>14.</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. Anglic. &amp; Aug. de temp. Ser. <hi>251.</hi>
                     </note> to appoint (by way of preparation) certain holy offices to be vſed on the Eve before:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18609:64"/>In like manner as pious and prudent is it for a Chriſtian Magiſtrate,<note place="margin">See this in his Majeſties Declarat.</note> not to ſuffer any ſportings or recreations, till all the publike Services of our God be ended for that preſent Day; and that none ſhould enjoy the benefit of this liberty, who hath not firſt reſorted to the Church; nor that it be abuſed, but uſed in a moderate, diſcreet, and pious way.</p>
                  <p>Now albeit this liberty be both thus qualified, and comes not in place till God be firſt ſerved; yet there want not thoſe, who trouble both the peace of the Church and State, by ſetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt it. But he who hath ſaid,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.6. &amp; Math. 12.7.</note> 
                     <hi>I will have mercy, and not ſacrifice,</hi> hath ſaid enough to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that he will not then be diſpleaſed at it; eſpecially in thoſe, whoſe education, or parts be ſuch, as are unfit for long meditation; the rigid tye whereof being laid upon them, makes the Reſt of this Day more burthenſome unto them, then their weekly labours. Or if Chriſt could ſay of the Jewiſh Sabbath, that <hi>it was made for man, and not man for it;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 12.8.</note> then much more may we affirme it of our Feſtivall, in as much as their yoake of ceremonious bondage belongs not to us.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit they are not to be excuſed, who have more minde of their Paſtime, then of their pious and holy worſhip; wiſhing in their hearts that the Prieſt would make a quicke diſpatch, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſhort the ſervice of the Day: For what is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18609:65"/>this but to have hell ſet at liberty, there being no better concord then thus betweene them and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. They doe indeed deſire to have a Day ſet apart: but becauſe they preferre the leſſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall end of its ſeparation before the chiefe; they obſerve a Day, not as they which obſerve it to the Lord, but as they that obſerve it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And therefore we juſtly reckon theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch, as are willingly deſirous to prophane this bleſſed Day, although it be now the Queene of dayes, and time of greateſt eminency for Gods publike worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Nor againe do we blame thoſe, who (without hypocriſie and ſuperſtition) ſpend the whole day in workes of piety and devotion. For, as Chriſt ſaid in ſome caſes, ſo may we ſay in this; it is a thing commendable:<note place="margin">Math. 19.12.</note> and therefore, <hi>Let him that is able to receive it, receive it,</hi> without judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of anothers liberty. The one may not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted irreligious or prophane, in the lawfulll uſe of his Chriſtian freedome; nor the other over ſtrict (if he judge not his brother) in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious meaſure of his more plentifull devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. And thus I have done with the firſt thing, the circumſtance of time. That of the place is next. This is the Temple, or Church: Gods Houſe, and his earthly Sanctuary, whereunto they who ſeeke his face will reſort: Which is as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſayd, <hi>In the Mountaine will the Lord
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18609:65"/>be ſeene.</hi> For though the Heaven of Heavens cannot containe him; or although in a ſtrict ſenſe hee dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, becauſe of his Omni-preſence. Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe he hath vouchſafed to afford different manners and degrees of his Preſence; and is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in Heaven, otherwiſe in earth.</p>
                  <p>Nor on earth is he every where alike; for in ſuch places as are dedicated to his Name,<note place="margin">1 King. 9 3. Pſal. 132.15.</note> he hath promiſed a more ſpeciall diſpenſation of his Preſence, then in places of common uſe, and to accept of them as his peculiar houſes. In to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken whereof, we doe not onely reade,<note place="margin">Pſal. 87.2.</note> that <hi>the Lord loveth the gates of Sion, more then all the dwellings of Iacob;</hi> and that he ſayd, his eyes and his heart ſhould be in that houſe which <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> had builded for him:<note place="margin">Pſal 42.2. Pſal 105.4. Pſal. 132.8. 2 Chro. 6.41 Gen. 4.14.15 Gen. 28.16 17.</note> but alſo that the ſayd Temple, Tabernacle, and firſt places of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe, are not ſeldome called the Reſt, and Face of God, and the gate of Heaven. Enough to ſignifie, that both by his more ſpeciall Preſence, and by a peculiaritie of proprietie, theſe places are become ſacred, and are ſo the Lords, as that they be no longer ours. He alſo herein vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing it as a ſpeciall honour, even to the places themſelves, that they be ſo called, named, and eſteemed; the comfortable effects of that by which the place is thus named, being alwaies ſuch as ſhall be ſure to ſhew themſelves,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.20. Pſal. 145.18.</note> by the religious ſinceritie of devoute worſhippers.</p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:18609:66"/>
                  <p>And if in the generall ſuch be not onely the peculiaritie of proprietie, but honour likewiſe of ſett and prepared places; then in particular, that which hath the moſt neere relation to his Preſence, muſt needs carry with it both the higheſt proprietie; and be alſo taken up in our regard, as the moſt Preſentiall place in all his Houſe. This the Ancients (as ſome alſo now adayes) did ſo well obſerve, that doing their obeyſance, they turned their faces this very way, and yet were neither ſuperſtitious, nor idolatrous for doing ſo. We profeſſe and ſay indeed the Lord is there, but not the Lord is this; and therefore are no more idolatrous then was <hi>David,</hi> in the fift <hi>Pſalme</hi> at the ſeventh verſe. Yea, in a word; if men were diſpoſed to be right, there ſtands before us in our aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, a chiefe ſigne of God's preſence; as being that from whence we have our perfecteſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the God of Heaven: For though it begins in Baptiſme, it ends in the Supper, nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then which we cannot goe, till we paſſe from hence to a better place. So that although he give us good aſſurance of his Preſence in ſundry things, and by many teſtimonies tells us truely, that he is with us; yet in nothing ſo much, nor ſo really, as in this high myſterie of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>And next, albeit every circumſtance, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the forme and faſhion of theſe places
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18609:66"/>not knowne at the firſt: yet 'twas a Dictate of the Law of nature, that ſome place, as well as ſome time, ſhould be holy to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>It had footing as ſoone as might be, Some ſay in Paradiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8. But more plainely after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: for the place mentioned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. unto which <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> brought their offerings (that their Father <hi>Adam,</hi> as a Prieſt might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to God for them) is, at the 14. and 16. verſes, called the Face or Preſence of God: that is, the Houſe of God, being that place where the publique and ſolemne ſervices of the Lord were uſually performed. For firſt they came unto it, ſayth the Text. Secondly, they brought their offerings thither. Thirdly, <hi>Cain</hi> alſo confeſſeth that he was excommunicated or driven away from thence; that is, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from the Congregation of the faithfull; (for <hi>Adam</hi> had ſundry other Children at the ſame time) as is ſignified at the fourteene verſe. How elſe could he be ſayd to goe out, or be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away from the preſence of the Lord, who in other reſpects is every where? And laſt of all, 'tis thus to be expounded, becauſe the Scriptures afterwards do ſo explaine the like phraſes; ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo punctually to our capacities, that whereas in one place it is, <hi>Bring an offering, and come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him:</hi> in another, 'tis, <hi>Bring an offering, and come into his Courts.</hi> See the proofes in the 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.29. and in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96.8.</p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:18609:67"/>
                  <p>By the face then, or Preſence of God, is here ſignified a peculiar ſacred place; where teaching, hearing, praying, ſacrificing, and other duties of Gods publique worſhip uſed to be performed. And ſo alſo in other the like phraſes of holy Scripture; for by them we know how to take up the true ſenſe of this.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards we alſo finde that the Patriarchs uſed Altars, Groves, and Mountaines, to the ſelfe-ſame purpoſe that <hi>Adam</hi> and his Sonnes before them, had uſed their foreſayd place of meeting. As for example, it is recorded in <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.4. that <hi>Abraham</hi> with all his houſhold went up from Egypt unto the place of the Altar which he had made there at the firſt; and there <hi>Abraham</hi> called on the name of the Lord. And againe [in <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.18.] we alſo finde, that when he came to <hi>Mamre</hi> and dwelled there, he built in that very place an Altar unto the Lord. And [in <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.33.] when he ſojourned in the Philiſtims land, he planted a Grove in Beer-ſheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlaſting God. And in the next Chapter 'tis alſo thus written, that when he was to offer up his ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he is directed to a Mountaine in the land of <hi>Moriab;</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>The feare of God,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a place not of common uſe, but for God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: as was ſignified afterwards more openly, when <hi>Solomon</hi> built there the holy Temple. Next look upon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who where he ſpread his Tent,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18609:67"/>built an Altar, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.25. But above all, that of <hi>Iacob</hi> is moſt remarkable; who, when he came to <hi>Luz,</hi> found that there was an houſe of God, which at the firſt he knew not, and is therefore ſaid to be afraid leſt perhaps he had offended in not ordering of himſelfe ſo there, as of right he knew he ought to doe in all ſuch places. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had he beene a ſtranger to ſuch choſen places, had he beene ignorant of their holineſſe, or had the knowledge of them been a new thing never heard of before among the Patriarchs, he had not now ſuſpected this to be God's houſe, nor the Gate of heaven.<note place="margin">See Gen. 28.11.16.17.18.19.</note> He lodged (ſaith the Text) in a certaine place, had there a viſion, and by vertue thereof he preſently declared, that this was no other then the houſe of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a place of feare and reverence. <hi>Intellexit Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>quod prius neſciebat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lipp. in Gen. <hi>28.</hi> ex Cajet.</note> 
                     <hi>tum Deum eſſe in illo loco tanquam in loco appropriato auditorii ſui.</hi> Briefly, if we look at nothing but his feare, 'tis enough to ſignifie, that he was no ſtranger to choſen places. For ſuppoſing it to be granted, that none of the Patriarchs had ever uſed to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip here: yet, that they had peculiar places, ſet apart from common uſe, is ſtill apparent: for leſſe then ſo cannot poſſibly be gathered hence.</p>
                  <p>Now then, if theſe things were thus before the Law, they are ill adviſed who care not for the difference of places after the Law: for if we be ſtill the worſhippers of our God, we muſt ſtill
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18609:68"/>have places for his holy worſhip, which muſt be dedicated and ſet apart only for him and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
                  <p>Nay, if we look no further then the dayes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and from thence caſt an eye to the times of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> it is ſufficient. For, as the Chriſtian religion is come in place of the Jewiſh: ſo are our Churches come in place of theirs. Their Tabernacle (ſaith one) was a patterne of their Temple, and their Temple a type of our Churches, even as all their ſervice was a type of our Chriſt. And alſo, as it was of old, <hi>Ye ſhall keepe my Sabbath, and reverence my Sanctuary;</hi> ſo now, the Sunday being God's holy day in ſtead of the Sabbath, the Church muſt be the place of his holy worſhip. Theſe two (in that very ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) hath the Lord ioyned together; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not for man to divorce, or put them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder. If we deny the place, we are againſt the day: but if we acknowledge the one, we grant the other.</p>
                  <p>In which regard,<note place="margin">Act. 18.11.</note> although St. <hi>Paul</hi> at the firſt, when he had iuſt occaſion given him to renounce the Iewes and their Synagogues,<note place="margin">Act. 28.8.</note> was neceſſitated to preach in a private houſe; yet, as ſoon as might be,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.22.33.34.</note> he took order for the building of Churches: teaching moreover, how both men and women ſhould behave themſelves in them. And ſo did other godly Chriſtians after him: They were carefull (even in the times of perſecution) to have
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18609:68"/>ſuch ſpeciall places erected. And although <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian</hi> made fearfull havock of them; yet no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was that godly <hi>Conſtantine</hi> become a Nurſing Father to the Church, but they were againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, their number much increaſed, and their beauty made apparent in a glorious and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming manner. Which, becauſe it was not ſo at the firſt, the Gentiles made a mock at Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as if they had neither Churches nor Altars: whereas in very deed they had them both. Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, though no ſuch ſtately ſtructures as were erected by the Gentiles: and Altars too, though not for ſuch ſacrifices as were theirs. For indeed, though perſecution kept the Chriſtians under, yet they laboured what they could to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared places for their holy worſhip, never meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elſewhere but when neceſſity urged them to it. And in this, though dead, they cry againſt our ſick-braine Schiſmaticks, who (upon no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity are in a manner as well devoted to any one place, they care not where, (either to a wood, a Chamber, a Parlour, or a Barne) as to a place ſeparated and dedicated on purpoſe to the God of heaven. This therefore makes them preach in chaires, and maintaine their faction in private conventicles, to the harme and detriment of God his Church. For 'tis without queſtion, that although Churches are not neceſſay <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate abſoluta;</hi> yet neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate conditiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta:</hi> that is, when we may enjoy them we muſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18609:69"/>(upon neceſſity) provide them; and being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, we muſt frequent, maintaine, honour, and reverence them as the Houſes of God, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his ſpeciall preſence here upon earth. So that as on the one ſide we blame all Schiſmaticks in that already mentioned: in like manner on the other ſide we blame both them and all rude kindes of people, who are not afraid to make as bold with God's houſe as with their owne, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no difference betweene things ſacred and prophane, betweene things ſet apart, and things of common uſe. God grant they repent not when it is too late: For it is <hi>Theodorets</hi> obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that againſt all <hi>Senacharibs</hi> army the Lord ſent forth but one Angel only; but againſt the prophaners of his Temple, ſix. For when <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> painted forth the abominations of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Ezek. c. 8. &amp;c. 9.</note> he ſaith, <hi>Behold there came ſix from the way of the upper gate, which looked towards the North, and every one of them had</hi> vaſa interfectionis, <hi>the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of ſlaughter in his hand.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 5.23.24. &amp;c.</note> And when <hi>Balthaſar</hi> was quaffing in the veſſels of the Temple, the hand-writing came againſt him; to ſignifie that he was weighed in the Ballance and found too light. And in times which do more neerly touch us, who hath not heard of that filthy <hi>Iulian,</hi> who was uncle to the Apoſtata? who hath not heard (I ſay) both of his irreligious actions, and his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment? This <hi>Iulian</hi> comming into a Church, beautified and adorned by that zealous <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:18609:69"/>made no more regard of it then if he had beene in a common Iakes or Stable; whereupon we reade, that he feared not to piſſe againſt the Holy Table, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> hath recorded.<note place="margin">Theod. lib. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>12.13.</hi>
                     </note> But the God of heaven, abhorring this wrong done to his Houſe and Altar in it, ſoone after laid his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie hand upon him, and ſtruck him with ſuch a fearfull diſeaſe, that his excrements forgat all their former paſſages, and found no other way then his wicked mouth, to evacuate themſelves from his hatefull body. So in like manner do we read of <hi>Felix,</hi> who only for ſcoffing at the plate belonging to that bleſſed Sacrament of the body and blood of our Saviour, was purſued by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine puniſhment: For ſo it was, that both night and day [quickly after] he never ceaſed to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit blood, till the rivolets of his veines,<note place="margin">Idem ibid.</note> and every other part of his body, became empty; and ſo he dyed, being overcome by the immediate hand of a juſt Revenger. And therefore, <hi>Procul ite prophani!</hi> for neither is this a place of common uſe, nor in theſe veſſels may you drink your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings draughts, nor uſe them ſafely at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon boards. The caſe you ſee is not altered yet; 'Tis <hi>nune ut olim</hi> ſtill: Chriſts comming hath not altered it. For as before he came, <hi>Balthaſar</hi> was puniſhed: ſo ſince his comming, not only were the buyers and ſellers whipt out of the Temple, but <hi>Iulian</hi> and <hi>Felix</hi> have beene met with. In which paſſage I would that this ſhould be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18609:70"/>marked, that it was not in the time of divine Service when <hi>Iulian</hi> piſſed againſt the Table; no holy congregation was then aſſembled: nor yet were the veſſels employed about holy actions, when filthy <hi>Felix</hi> ſcoffed at them: and therefore in theſe things and places, there is ſuch a relative propriety as never ceaſeth; but makes them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes Holy, and alwayes His, to whom they be dedicated and ſet apart. Which how it makes for thoſe, who think that they have yeelded farre enough, if they honour God's houſe on the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, though they diſreſpect it, or behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves rudely in it all the week after, let any man be Iudge: for ſuch thoughts are apparently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull; and therefore ſuch men muſt rectifie themſelves, and returne to a better minde, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they perſiſt in a banefull evill. Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> I remember, reporteth, that the Goths ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſackt Rome, as many of the people as betook themſelves to the Churches of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> remained free; ſo much could the reſpect of ſacred places prevaile, even with thoſe cruell Barbarians.<note place="margin">Ambr. lib. <hi>5.</hi> epiſt <hi>33.</hi>
                     </note> Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> alſo witneſſeth, that the reverence of holy Altars prevailed ſo far with the foreſaid Souldiers, that they willingly fell downe and kiſſed them. And Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> againſt <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> ſaith; <hi>Confiteor timorem meum;</hi> I confeſſe my feare, when entring into the Temple of the<note n="*" place="margin">Churches are not crect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Saints or Martyrs, but to their and our God, in memory of them. So alſo concerning Holy dayes.</note> Martyrs, I conceive any anger or evill thought in my minde. But what ſhall I
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18609:70"/>need to ſay any more, ſeeing the very feaſts of Charitie were driven hence; as in the Councell of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> at the twenty eighth Canon is declared.</p>
                  <p>And next, whereas ſome make doubt whether it be lawfull for Chriſtians in the contriving of their Churches, to have an eye upon the Fabrick of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple: My anſwere is; that as that proportion of time for Gods holy worſhip is moſt warrantable, which he himſelfe ordained; So that forme or faſhion of place is beſt to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, which he himſelfe delivered: other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions have no warrant. It is true indeed, that they were <hi>Iewes,</hi> and we are Chriſtians; and therefore there muſt be a difference between us: Yet the difference herein, needs not to be in the forme of our Fabricks, but in the uſe of the Courts and places, which are ſo divided, as if the one tooke patterne from the other. And ſo indeed they did; for as to the one there was an <hi>Atrium exterius,</hi> an <hi>Atrium interius,</hi> a <hi>Sanctum,</hi> and a <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum:</hi> So to the other, a <hi>Locus Poen tentium, Auditorium, Preſbyterium,</hi> and <hi>Sacrarium.</hi> Of the firſt and ſecond <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> ſpeaketh, in the ſixt booke, and 33<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.

                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:18609:71"/>And of the two laſt, <hi>Theod ret</hi> makes mention, in the relation of that paſſage which was betweene <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and Saint <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> For Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> putting the Emperour in mind of the difference of places;<note place="margin">Theod lib. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>17.</hi>
                     </note> telleth him plainly, that the <hi>Locainteriora</hi> ſhould not be entred, but by the Prieſts onely. And this he ſayd, not onely in regard of the Altar-place, but of the whole Quire, or Chancell, which was ſevered from the bodie of the Church <hi>per Cancellos,</hi> whereupon it was called a Chancell; even as the proprietie thereof cauſed it bee named <hi>Preſbyterium;</hi> that is, a place only for the Prieſts, peculiarly and ſolely belonging unto them.<note place="margin">Revel. c. 4. &amp;c. 7. verſ. 11.</note> At which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo pointed, when he ſaw the Presbyters, or 24.

                  <p>The Throne then and place of Majeſtie muſt be firſt; that's the holy Table within the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> and anſwers to the Mercie Seate, and <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> among the <hi>Iewes;</hi> in which the moſt excellent part of their typicall ſervice was perfomed. And well may I ſay that it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers thereunto; For as then there was to be a proper and ſelected place for that Ceremony of expiating of the people: So now, for the Commemorating thereof (not as it was a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, but as it was in act performed by our
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18609:71"/>Saviour) There is to be in our Churches a <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> ſtill, wherein we are to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the memorie of Chriſts ſacrifice, in thoſe holy Myſteries which he himſelfe ordained, and commanded to be done.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Preſbyterium</hi> muſt bee next, being the Court of the Prieſts: In which Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> would not that ſo much as the Emperour ſhould have a ſeate,<note place="margin">Sozom. lib. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>24.</hi>
                     </note> but ordered that he ſhould be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced without, immediately next to thoſe barres or lattices which ſevered the Church from the Chancell. Nor was the Emperour any whit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; for he knew (as the ſayd Father told him) that Purple made no Prieſts: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch places as belonged unto them, he would bee carefull ever after not to meddle with.</p>
                  <p>Then next after this muſt be the Court of the people; for though the booke of the <hi>Revelation</hi> be very myſticall, yet (as I have elſe-where ſhewed) ſeeing the viſions there mentioned of things appertaining to the Chriſtians, do ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently allude to the faſhions of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and are expreſſed as if they were repreſented to Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Heavens; it is as if it ſhould be ſayd, <hi>Gods Church is in it ſelfe but one, though the parte be two; Militant, and Triumphant. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Church of the Iewes was ordered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what this holy Man ſaw in the Heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him: ſo ought the Church of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:18609:72"/>as being ſurrogated into their roome for whom the Temple was built.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall not need to ſpeake much more; for the <hi>Locus Poenitentium</hi> is the Porch, and anſwereth to thoſe outward Courts which were of old. Onely herein ther's one thing yet to be diſcuſſed, concerning the <hi>Preſbyterium,</hi> and <hi>Sacrarium,</hi> for ſome have gone about to perſwade, that they were not at the end of the Church, becauſe <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> ſeemes [to them] to ſpeake as if they were in the middeſt,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. <hi>10.</hi> eccleſ. biſt. c. <hi>4.</hi> ex orat. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugyrica in Encaniſs.</note> and ſo our moderne Fabrickes are differing from thoſe among the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. But I anſwer, that in caſe it were ſo in ſome Churches, yet are they but exceptions in particular, and nothing at all againſt a generall order. Nor is it cleare to be ſo at all, by that which is urged; for <hi>Euſebius</hi> doth more plainly ſay, that the Altar in the Church there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, was in the middle of the Chancell, than that the Chancell and Altar were in the middle of the Church. And yet this [even thus; that is, ſuppoſing the Altar there to be in the middle of the Chancell, rather than at the upper end thereof, in the middle betweene North, and South] being but a particular inſtance, can be no fit preſident to be oppoſed againſt a generall practiſe: For generally the <hi>Altarium,</hi> or place allotted for the Altar (which I have formerly mentioned by the name of <hi>Sacrarium</hi>) was in the Eaſt, at the upper end of the Quire or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:18609:72"/>as is apparent by that of <hi>Socrates;</hi> who takes ſpeciall notice of that Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Socrat. hiſt. Eccleſ lib. <hi>5.</hi> cap. <hi>21.</hi>
                     </note> in which the Altarſtood at the weſtern end thereof, contrary to the ſcituation of it in other Churches. And againe, that the <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terium,</hi> Quire, or Chancell was not in the middle of the Church, and all the people round about it; appeareth by that of Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotting the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> a place within the bodie of the Church, immediately before thoſe bars or lattices which ſevered the Church, from the Chancell, of which I have ſpoken a little before. And this the ſayd <hi>Ambroſe</hi> did, that ſo the Emperour might have a place before the people, as had the Prieſts before the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: for as a learned D. hath fully proved,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn, Antid. Lincoln. c. <hi>7.</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>Altarium,</hi> or <hi>Sacrarium;</hi> this being the whole ſpace purpoſely ſet apart for the Altar, or holy Table, and was ſevered from the reſt of the Chancell, by Rayles, or Curtaine. To which may be added that ancient cuſtome of praying Eaſt-ward, and then ther's nothing to be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted further.</p>
                  <p>And now if this be not enough to prove, that God muſt have his houſe on earth [yea and thus contrived too, if a right order be well obſerved, and not otherwiſe ſtopped] then nothing can.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:18609:73"/>For though the <hi>Iewes</hi> indeed had their higheſt Court at the other end, becauſe their times were darke in reſpect of ours; yet we having been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by that Day-ſpring from on high, do turne our faces toward the Eaſt, have there the place of higheſt Majeſtie: and by turning thither, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our times, to be thoſe very times of light, wherein the ſignification of their ſhadowes is accompliſhed, as I have elſe where ſhewed more at large. And laſt of all, to ſpeake more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; the Lord being to have ſuch peculiar pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as Temples, or Churches, it is the peoples duties to reſort unto them, there to expreſſe their praiſes, poure out their prayers, and heare the preachings of his Prieſts.<note place="margin">1 Tim 2.8.</note> For although pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately a man may pray any where, as occaſion ſhall require,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.22.</note> lifting up pure hands, &amp;c. yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe to abhorre publicke meetings; is to deny ourſelves to be any of Gods people. For as we are all members of one body, we muſt joyntly aſſemble to one place; ſo ſhall we keep the unitie of the ſpirit in the bond of peace, and be ſo in the number of Gods people here, that we may the better know how to be taken into the number of them heareafter: For the Prophet is witneſſe, that God will teach his wayes to thoſe who ſhall go and ſay; <hi>Come, and let us aſcend to the Mountaine of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Iacob.</hi> Eſay. 2.3.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. But (as I ſayd before) ſome be Truants
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18609:73"/>and care not for comming. Others be Recuſants, and may not come to joyne themſelves with us. A third ſort be Schiſmaticks, and will not come except where they affect, and when they pleaſe. And laſt of all, there be others which make no great ſcruple of comming; but in reſpect of the end, their comming and hearing is in vaine, they are yet in their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Truants are of two ſorts; either ſuch as hate the Word in reſpect of it ſelfe, or ſuch as are ill affected towards it for ſome by reſpect.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe eſteeme preaching but folly. There is much adoe in it and about it; but it is to ſmall purpoſe. They can ſee no good that it doth to have one ſtand an houre together perking in a pulpit: for this doth but hinder the people from their buſineſſe, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> once ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> Let him that is a Preacher ſay there what he liſt, they will beleeve but what they pleaſe. The Miniſter muſt doe ſomething for his living, and if he could not talke for it, he could doe little. And yet that which he doth, ſeemes (in their judgement) to be as much as nothing. Wherefore, if all were of their mindes, he might ſpeak long enough before he be regarded.</p>
                  <p>To whom I anſwer, that although the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God be fooliſhnes to the wicked world, yet it hath pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching to ſave thoſe that beleeve.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.18. to ver. 28. &amp; chap. 2.14.</note> And there fore, if our Goſpell be hid, it is hid to them that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18609:74"/>be loſt; whoſe mindes are darkned by the god of this world,<note place="margin">2 Co. 4.3 4.</note> Sathan, that prince of darkneſſe, who ſtriveth to extinguiſh the glorious light that it bringeth with it. It is without queſtion that the time may come, when theſe men (ſince they call it talking) may talke for mercy too,<note place="margin">Prov. 28.9. Rom. 1.16.</note> and go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Wherefore I am not aſhamed of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt: for it is the power of God unto ſalvation, to every one that beleeveth; to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Centile. And in a word, as lightly as theſe account of the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.16.</note> and the preaching thereof, it ſhall one day judge them. Yea and now, whilſt they live in this valley of the ſhadow of death, if they were well grounded in it, and humbly devoted towards it, they might finde comfort in what they have learned from thence, when all the world beſide is but a dry and a barren tree, and can afford nothing of ſo ſweet a nature. We are not mad men to macc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our ſelves in ſtudying away our blood, ſpirits, ſtrengty, and health: but that we know God hath ordain'd us to be Labourers in his harveſt,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.9.</note> and would that the worſt under us, ſhould of tares become good corne. If therefore theſe men pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, let them thanke themſelves; for they reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt. There is no fault in the Word, but in them, who doe ſo lightly and ſlightly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it. For, though to them it be meere foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe, yet to God and the faithfull it is farre otherwiſe.</p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:18609:74"/>
                  <p>And as for the ſecond, they be ſuch as hate the Word and the hearing of it, becauſe it croſſeth them in their wicked projects, and diveliſh pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices. For cannot a Tyrant be bloody, an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſour cruſh and grinde the poore, a Tradeſman lye and ſweare, a Flatterer diſſemble, an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite weare a mask, a Gallant frequent the ſtews, an Uſurer undoe his brother, an Incloſer depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate, a Drunkard reele in the ſtreets, and know the way to an Ale-houſe better then to God's houſe; or cannot a Blaſphemer curſe and ſweare, a Church-robber commit ſacriledge, a Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter detract, a Malicious man wreck his ſpleene, a Monopoliſt engroſſe, a Proud man look aloft, a wanton Dame uſe her paintings, a Cormorant withhold his corne to the ſtarving of the poore, a Poore man deſpiſe the rich, a Land-lord undoe his tenants, a Voluptuous man bath himſelfe in ſinfull luſts, vanities, and wicked pleaſures, but the Pulpit muſt needs proclaime it? <hi>Hinc illa lachrymae;</hi> this is their great <hi>Cordolium.</hi> If we could but let them alone, and not hinder them in their travell to Tophet, then all were well: But becauſe we call them back from their evill wayes, croſſe them in their proiects, and in the cleare glaſſe of God's word let them ſee their faces, they hate the hearing of the Word, detract and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite the Preachers of it;<note place="margin">1 King. 22.8.</note> like unto <hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who hated <hi>Michaiah</hi> becauſe he propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contrary to his liking: <hi>He propheſieth</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18609:75"/>he) <hi>no good to me, but evill.</hi> Or like unto thoſe in the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 16.19. &amp; Act. 19 24</note> who abominated the doctrine of the Apoſtles, becauſe it croſſed thoſe wicked gaines which their diveliſh and heatheniſh practices brought in unto them. By which it appeareth, that as Truth loves no corners: ſo neither would they beare hatred to it, if their deeds were but ſuch as might abide the tryall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The next are Papiſts, or Recuſants; a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo wedded to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they may not ioyne themſelves with us in our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: and this, not becauſe they have any iuſt quarrell againſt our Liturgy; but becauſe they are afraid of the Popes curſe. As for our doctrine, if That diſpleaſe them, I am ſory the Truth ſhould prove diſtaſtfull. Or if we have enough in our Religion neceſſary to ſalvation, what need we more? And that we have ſo much, is witneſſed by a Pope, <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> by name; who ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Letter to Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of bleſſed memory (before the time of his excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion denounced againſt her) that he did allow our Bible and Book of Divine Service,<note place="margin">See Iudge <hi>Cook</hi> in his Charge at <hi>Norwich</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſes, Anno Dom. 1606.</note> as it is now uſed among us, to be authentick, and not repugnant to truth; and that therein was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained enough neceſſary to ſalvation: as in a charge given at <hi>Norwich</hi> Aſſiſes, in the yeare of our Lord 1606, was openly avowed. And if enough, then without queſtion we need not the help of any Pope to ſupply us with more. Unto
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18609:75"/>which, this I adde, that it can be no harme to the Papiſts to turne unto us: for, in departing from them, we made not a New Church, but refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the old: and, among the Churches refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, this of <hi>England</hi> comes (I dare ſay) neareſt to thoſe of the Primitive times; and ſhall (I hope) come every day more neare then other to them: inſomuch, that if then it might be truly ſaid, not only that the <hi>Kings daughter was all glorious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> but that her clothing likewiſe was of wrought gold; ſo alſo now. For whereas the factious from time to time, together with their ſilly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, have endeavoured to cry downe that uniformity which beſt becommeth God's pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like worſhip, it is more like to be advanced now then ever, ſince the dayes of Reformation. And 'tis for certaine a good and pious worke: God's bleſſing therefore light upon them, who do their beſt to ſet it forward: for it will cauſe that beauty of holineſſe to be apparent, which beſt beſeemes devote, ſincere, and pious worſhippers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third ſort are Schiſmaticks; a perverſe and peeviſh generation, who will not come but where they affect, and when they pleaſe: and yet theſe be they who are all for hearing. For were it not for Sermons, it were more then a miracle to ſee them approach God's holy Temple. And ſo Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> obſerved of ſome in his time,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. hom. <hi>3.</hi> in <hi>2</hi> Theſſ.</note> ſaying thus, <hi>Why therefore do we enter the Church, except we may heare one ſtand up and preach.</hi> And
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18609:76"/>yet not every one neither: For it is ſeldome when that their owne Paſtor can pleaſe them. They have an itch in their braines, and muſt be fed by ſuch as they beſt affect: and as for Learning and Conformity, they grinne and ſnarle againſt it. This maketh them runne to and fro to ſeeke out ſuch as ſpit againſt ſet forms of prayer, diſreſpect Churches, delight in the breach of Canons, hate Diſcipline, contemne orders, and deſpiſe Biſhops, although the Scriptures teach them a leſſon which is cleane contrary; and in particular telleth not obſcurely, that <hi>He who wil not obey the Church muſt be accounted as an Heathen and a Publican:</hi> Math. 18.17.</p>
                  <p>But let the Scripture ſay what it wil, if it makes againſt them, ſuch is their humour that they care not for it: and therefore, they who be moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, are beſt affected. Theſe they will follow from pariſh to pariſh, from town to towne, from city to city, from one kingdome to another peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yea from one <hi>England</hi> to another. And if it be that upon neceſſity they muſt ſometimes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent their owne pariſh Churches, they will (if it be poſſible) be <hi>Tardè venientes, Late commers;</hi> for what care they for Common prayers? That kinde of Service may not be touched; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne, they ſcoffe, they inveigh againſt it. But let them take heed, that this foule ſinne be never laid unto their charge. They ſinke without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, who perſiſting kicke at what they ſhould
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18609:76"/>embrace. And therefore let them take heed (I ſay) that God wipe not out their names out of the Booke of life, for ſcorning that Booke which (as I have elſe where ſhewed) containes the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the living God, in which I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to his holy Word. For although the Prayers be ſhort, mixed with many ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the forme of them be ſet, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by men <hi>ex tempore,</hi> yet is it no juſt plea to except againſt them.

It was certainely in another caſe, that Chriſt would not have his Apoſtles to be carefull what to ſpeake; for this was in caſes of perſecution,<note place="margin">Math. 10.19.</note> when they ſhould be enabled to ſpeake before thoſe, unto whoſe judgement Seate they ſhould be brought; a ſingular gift in thoſe dayes to the holy Martyrs.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18609:77"/>ſince. For firſt, they did not onely pray in thoſe very words, and ſeaſon all their ſervice with that Prayer of the Lord; but even the Prayers that they made were <hi>Creberrimae &amp; breviſſimae,</hi> frequent, and full of fervent brevitie: Becauſe in a long and tedious Prayer, not well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted, as there may be many vaine and idle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.16</note> ſo a weake devotion may be loſt, but being ſhort, often <hi>Amens,</hi> and anſwers are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and ſo the attention kept the better wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. And by how much the more earneſt, by ſo much the ſhorter and fuller of ejaculations, as in the end of our <hi>Letanie</hi> well appeareth.

                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo alſo for the ſecond, they uſed formes, ſet and digeſted; leaſt ſomewhat might be utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red through ignorance or careleſſeneſſe, which might be contrary to the Faith, as in ancient councells is declared.<note place="margin">Concil. <hi>3.</hi> of Carth c. <hi>23.</hi> Concil.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:18609:78"/>Chriſtian world. They profeſſe themſelves to be Hearers; but if you talke with them, they are then become Preachers rather then Hearers; bragging that Lay-men know the meaning of the Scriptures as well as Prieſts, and therefore need none of their directions, excepting when they direct according to what is already fixed in ſuch a peoples fancy. For I know well enough the bent of their bowes: either we muſt preach what and how they will heare, or they will not heare what or how we preach. All, or the moſt of them, hate a written Sermon as abominable. But, as before they might have remembred, not only that the Scriptures are not of private inter preta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the Prieſts lips are to preſerve knowledge,<note place="margin">Mal. 2 7.

                  <p>But what care they for this? and therefore, to pleaſe the fancies of not a few, we muſt roll out
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:18609:78"/>our Sermons without premeditation, or elſe their tongues are fierce againſt us.

                  <p>But do I ſpeak any jot of this to beget a dearth of Sermons? it is farre from me: for I know that there is no famine, like that of the Word.

                     </note> Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> well approveth, as may be ſeene towards the latter end of his fourth booke <hi>De doctrina Chriſtiana.</hi> For, if he holds concerning ſome in his time, who knew better how to pronounce then to make a Sermon, that they did not amiſſe to ſeeke the benefit of their people by preaching what others had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; then it muſt needs follow, as an order fit to be embraced, that we neglect not the reading of Homilies, at ſuch times as we have no other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: for hereby, having the more time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide us, our owne Sermons will be the better, and fitter to be preached. They who have a charge under them, and be not able to doe this, if aged, muſt be helped; if indiſcreet and ignorant, doing things ridiculouſly, or abuſing things they meddle with, ought to be removed; for they have but crept in, to the diſhonour of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, (like him among the gueſts) and want their wedding garment. Wherefore, all theſe things
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18609:80"/>being well weighed, they be more nice then wiſe, more rude then learned, more envious then cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, who inveigh ſo much at they know not what.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The laſt are next: Let them be ſummed up, and thus they ſtand. <hi>The wandring hearer; the wondring, or curious hearer; the accidentall hearer; the pleaſing hearer; the ſcoffing hearer; the criticall or cavilling hearer; and the envious hearer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the firſt of theſe I doe not meane ſuch wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers as the former, who trot up and downe the country and the world for freſh paſture; but ſuch, as comming to the Church (either becauſe they would not be accounted Atheiſts, or becauſe they are loath to fall into the hazard of forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) &amp; there being ſet, preſently fall either a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, a gazing, or apratling: their corn, their cattel, their market, or other ſuch like worldly buſines; or in ſome, the thoughts of their pleaſures, ſports, and paſtimes, make them forget themſelves, and tranſport their minds from the matter for which they were called: for by theſe they are captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and ſo (though they come to heare) the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Church, or ſtones in the wall (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſound of words) heare as much as they. Neither is it but that ſometimes this their brown ſtudy of wandring, ſhuts up their eyes as well as their eares; and ſo they ſcarce heare ſo much as before; not the ſound of words: but are even as a dead corps before the Preacher: and he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18609:80"/>them, as if he were preaching at their unworthy funerals. But [in <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7.] <hi>Paul</hi> preached, and the people heard him till midnight: One on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (namely <hi>Eutichus</hi>) fell aſleepe; and he (as ye know) was taken up dead; the reſt watched. Whereupon a Father thus obſerveth, <hi>Media nocte vigilant, ut eos condemnent qui media die dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt.</hi> Or if they wander not in muſing, nor drown their ſenſes in a ſilent ſleepe, they runne in the maze of uncomely gazing, looking about to ſee what others doe, how the time paſſeth, who comes in, or what they weare; who hath the beſt flowers, the neweſt faſhion, or the fineſt dreſſe. But while they looke thus after ſuch things, they harme their ſoules, they loſe their God. Or if they wander neither in muſing, nor gazing, they are carried away with vaine talking, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate whiſpering one with another; it being an ordinary thing for ſuch as theſe, to tattle toyes in the eares of their neighbours. But the very Turks doe farre excell them; they goe beyond them, and ſhall therefore riſe up in judgement againſt them, as is ſaid of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> againſt the Jews: for they doe not only put off their ſhooes from their feet, when they enter into their Churches, otherwiſe called their <hi>Moſchits;</hi> but doe alſo ſo attend their ſeruice, that (as ſome have ſaid it) if by chance they doe but ſcratch their heads, they think all their former devotion to be loſt. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this I am ſure of, that when Chriſt preached
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18609:81"/>in the Synagogue,<note place="margin">Luke 4.20.</note> the eyes of all the people were fixed on him. And when <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſtood and talked to the Cripple,<note place="margin">Act. 3.4.</note> whom they intended to heale, they commanded him that he ſhould attend them, ſaying, <hi>Looke on us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond (as I ſaid) is the wondring or curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearer. For firſt, though hee comes not to wander, he comes many times to wonder; and in concluſion can tell you nothing but this, <hi>The Preacher made an excellent Sermon, Is a rare man,</hi> and the like. But what good doth this excellent Sermon to ſuch an Hearer? Little or nothing. For indeed how can it, unleſſe he comes with a purpoſe to lead his life as the Word (and not as the world, fleſh, and the divell) ſhall teach him. Or ſecondly, put the caſe that this hearer bee ſometimes ſuch a one as is more expert in witty conceits then the vulgar: if ſo, then his curioſity goeth yet a little higher. For as the Oyſter lyes and gapes for a freſh Tide, ſo he for fine words, compt phraſes, ſmackes of eloquence; and by theſe he intends to better his diſcourſe. But if it chance that he meet no ſuch paſſage, he thinks the time tedious, and his labour loſt: for it was not Matter, but Words that he came to heare; and ſo he goes home, and will not ſtick to ſay, <hi>He hath heard nothing.</hi> How beit I doe not condemne ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of phraſe; it is a ſingular gift: and to cloth good matter in elegant words, winneth many times even an unwilling hearer. But as Preachers
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:18609:81"/>may not ayme at Words without Matter; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may the people catch at the ſhadow, and loſe the ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>The third of this ſort be Accidentall hearers; ſuch as thinke themſelves more bound to Man then God: for it is by reaſon of the ſervice which they owe to the one, that they ſometimes come and ſeeme to ſerve the other. The world hath many ſuch, who care not for coming, were it not upon that occaſion: and theſe chiefly are thoſe idle Serving-men, who (having crept into the ſervice of ſome great man here upon earth) forget, that both they and their maſters have a Maſter in heaven.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is the Pleaſing hearer, neare of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the former: for hoping for ſome por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or preferment, from ſome friend or other, who is better devoted then himſelfe, he dares not diſpleaſe him: This makes him come, although he leaves his eares behinde him. So his body be there, it makes no matter for his heart, his minde, his ſoule: The one he knowes is ſeene, the other hid. But becauſe he halts where he ſhould bee ſound, 'tis morethen probable that both he and his companions goe out of the Church as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane beaſts went out of the Arke; that is, they goe out uncleane, as they came in uncleane: and for having no greater love to God's houſe here upon earth, are not unlike to loſe the faire beauty of it in the glorious heaven.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:18609:82"/>
                  <p>The fift is the ſcoffing Hearer: he hath learned of the naturall man to be a kinde of Atheiſt; and though he hath (as a man may think) the outward formality of a Chriſtian, yet doe but marke him, and you ſhall finde, that he mocketh at nothing more, then at the Ordinances of God: like unto that wicked miſcreant,<note place="margin">Theod. lib. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>12.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note> revolting <hi>Felix;</hi> who, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the coſtly veſſels of the Temple, which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had beſtowed, ſaid: <hi>En qualibus vaſis miniſtratur Mariae ſilio:</hi> See with what plate the ſonne of <hi>Mary</hi> muſt be ſerved. But what was his end, already hath beene ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>The next are the Critical or Cavilling hearers, ſuch as love well the ſociety of factious oppoſites: for they come as the Phariſees came to heare Chriſt; to intrap and traduce the Preacher for his doctrine. Theſe commonly have a Theology of their owne; and all that makes againſt it, is (in their eſteeme) but falſe Divinity: Or if it be not, they wiſh it were, that thereby the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter may be queſtioned; and ſometimes, rather then he ſhall be innocent, they will wreſt his words to a contrary ſenſe. But to theſe may be ſaid, as that Father, holy <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> once ſaid to his carping Hearers:<note place="margin">Greg. Naz. in Orat. quâ ſe purgat.</note> 
                     <hi>Ye ſheepe, feed not your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, nor be ye lift up above them: —Iudge not your Iudges, nor give lawes to your Law-givers: for God is not a God of tumults, but of peace and order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſeventh and laſt, is the envious hearer; not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18609:82"/>ſo much againſt the Prieſt, as againſt his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Ye may eaſily know him: for he ſits like a malecontent, very ſad and ſorrowfull (as if he were a deafe man and heard not) untill he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Preacher hath a ſpeciall ayme at ſome one or other whom he himſelfe hateth: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thought of which he cheeres up his ſpirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to looke like a willing hearer, and is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well content to drinke up with greedineſſe ſuch a paſſage; thinking it no ſmall happineſſe to have his eares bleſſed with the vineger and gall of that particular. But if this be hearing, I am much deceived:<note place="margin">Luk. 8.8.18.</note> For <hi>he that hath an care to heare</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>let him heare:</hi> yea, and take heed likewiſe how he heareth. Not turne aſide and ſtop his eare: for then he doth not heare at all. Nor heare as himſelfe pleaſeth: for then he hears amiſſe. But heare as he ought; that thereby he may heare indeed: and ſo at the laſt, he ſhall be one day taken to that happy and joyfull place of <hi>ſeeing:</hi> yea, and ſing that ſong;<note place="margin">Pſal. 48.8.</note>

                  <p>Let it therefore be that you heare; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo,<note place="margin">Math. 7.26.

                  <p>And verily, a law and cuſtome of the Church, was heretofore of greater weight, than to be of light eſteeme: The ancients thought it to be a good argument of it ſelfe alone, to convince o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their ſtrugglings.

For though it were accounted lawfull, or indifferent before, is now as if the nature of it were altered, or not ſo warrantable as before it was commanded. Why elſe doe they queſtion what the Church enjoyneth, and like quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome high-minded people, love to dwell in the fiery flames of contention? It is a ſigne of ſome diſtemper; a diſtemper that commeth of an heat or humour of pride: for (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh) <hi>Only by pride commeth contention;</hi>

But as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith of Love, ſo may I ſay of Obedience; namely, How can they obey God whom they have not ſeene, if they will not obey the officers of his Church whom they have ſeene? For as judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Hooker</hi> truly ſpeaketh, It doth not ſtand with the duty which we owe to our heavenly Father, (who is the univerſall Father of us all) that to the ordinances of our mother the Church, we ſhould ſhew our ſelves diſobedient. Let us not ſay wee keepe the Commandements of the one, when we breake the Lawes of the other: for unleſſe wee obſerve both, we obey neither. And againe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt (ſaith he) hath promiſed to be with his Church untill the end of the world, her Laws and Ordinances cannot be contemned or broken, without wrong and deſpight to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:18609:87"/>
                  <p>Neither doe the words of <hi>Solomon</hi> but tend to the ſame purpoſe. For he doth not only ſay,<note place="margin">Prov. 1.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Heare thy fathers inſtruction;</hi> but addeth alſo, <hi>and forſake not thy mothers teaching.</hi> By Father, meaning ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God who is the univerſall Father of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; or the Paſtours of the Church, who are ſent of God as Ghoſtly Fathers, to teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the people: And by Mother, meaning the Governours of the Church; as even the <hi>Genevae</hi> note declareth. Or more plainly thus; They who teach and inſtruct thee in the Word, muſt be heard: and not only ſo, but even the laws and directions of the Guides and Rulers (who ſit to governe) may not be neglected. And what our Saviours doctrine likewiſe is, concerning this, you have heard already; and may heare more afterwards, when you have read a little further.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time if I be deſired to ſpeak more plainely concerning the word <hi>Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What is meant by the word Church and of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the phraſe from Father to Mother.</note> whoſe lawes muſt be obeyed. My anſwer is, that here is not meant the whole popular or collective company of beleevers, but the Church in her Officers; which is differing from the popular and promiſcuous bodie thereof. For the Church is either repreſentative, or collective. By the firſt is meant onely the ſpiritualitie, and chiefely the governing Fathers, or higheſt Prieſts. By the ſecond, all others (as well as the former, them and all) who live within the compaſſe or pale of one &amp; the ſame Church. And becauſe the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18609:88"/>whole Church together is oftentimes reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to a woman bringing forth, and nouriſhing up of Children unto Chriſt; we ſometimes alter the phraſe from Father, to Mother, although we ſpeake but of the Church in a repreſentative bodie, where (by a Synecdoche) one part is put for the whole.</p>
                  <p>But I proceed.<note place="margin">A twofold objection.</note> And here ſome object, that the Church officers either bring in rites, and orders, at which their conſcience ſtumbleth.

For it is to be feared, that ſome of them which pretend weakneſſe and doubting, are (as King <hi>Iames</hi> obſerveth) ſtrong enough, and ſuch as think themſelves able to teach the King, and all the Biſhops of the Land. In which caſe there is (I thinke) no better way to cure them,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18609:88"/>then that <hi>Aarons</hi> rod ſhould devoure their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents: otherwiſe they will not only hiſſe againſt, but alſo ſting (where they can) the boſome of the Church. Now in this, perhaps (as their cuſtome is) they will be ready to complaine of cruelty and perſecution. But doe they not know, <hi>Non eſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delit as pro Deo pietas:</hi> as ſaith Saint <hi>Hierom?</hi> Zeale for God and the Churches peace, is no cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty: neither are they perſecuted whom the hand of Juſtice puniſheth for breaking the Law. They may beare the world in hand, that they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for their conſcience; and abuſe the credulity of the ſimple herein: but wiſe and moderate men know the contrary. For as Seminary Prieſts and Jeſuites give it out, that they are martyred for their Religion; when the very truth is, they are juſtly executed for ther prodigious treaſons, and felonious or treacherous practices againſt lawfull Princes and Eſtates. So the diſturbers of the Churches peace pretend they are perſecuted for their conſciences; when they are indeed but juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cenſured for their obſtinate and pertinacious contempt of lawfull authority. Could they well remember it, 'tis they who be the true <hi>Iſmaels;</hi> not ceaſing to infeſt their better brethren: making head againſt their Heads; and crying out like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Libertines, that all their Chriſtian liberty is deſtroyed: And why, but becauſe in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of order, the private fancies of every idle head, or addle braine, may not countermand the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18609:89"/>warrantable authority of a publike Law, nor ſet downe ſuch Rites as ſhall better pleaſe them, or (in their judgements) be thought more fitting then ſuch as the Church ordaineth. This were indeed to invade anothers right; to give Lawes to our Law-givers; an <hi>Huſteron Proteron:</hi> and therefore may not be. Nay were it ſo, that every man ſhould be left to his owne liberty, then look how many Congregations, ſo many varieties. There would be (I dare ſay) little or no concord, but in diverſities and diſagreements; and ſo the Church of God, in one and the ſame Kingdome, ſhould be rent and torne moſt miſerably. The fourth Councell of <hi>Toledo</hi> had an eye hereunto,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Symſon</hi> hiſt. of the Church, lib. 4. pag. 527</note> and did therefore (in the ſecond Canon thereof) enjoyne one uniforme order in their Church ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And ſurely, ſeeing Chriſt's coat was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeame, there is no reaſon why in one and the ſame Kingdome the orders ſhould be different. It were rather to be wiſhed that the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church throughout the Chriſtian world, under her ſeveral governours in every Kingdome or Church Nationall, were ordered after one and the ſame manner: but becauſe this cannot be in every reſpect (either in regard of the places, times, or conditions of the people) it is left to the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every Church to appoint ſuch as ſhall beſt ſerve them for decency, order, and edification: For if they be deſtitute of theſe properties, they are but brutiſh and inſignificant, altogether unfit
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:18609:89"/>to ſtirre up the dull minde of man to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance or expreſſion of his duty to God. For as it is with Tongues, ſo with Ceremonies: if they be darke and obſcure, or not underſtood, they cannot edifie. Many ſuch are at this day in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and I thanke God that we of this Church are free enough from them. It were well therefore that what appertaines unto us, were better obſerved: for, in the generall, their inſtitution is divine, though in many of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars they be but humane. And yet not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether humane neither: For even the particulars are partly humane, partly divine; as being a part of that order and decorum which God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in generall, leaving the particulars to the diſcretion of the Church, to be framed according to that generall rule in holy Scripture: which being obſerved, they cannot but be good, true, holy, and pleaſing unto God. Adde moreover, that there be ſome particulars warrantable from Text, as wel as Canon, as uncovering of the head, bowing at the name of Jeſus, kneeling, &amp;c.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.4. Philip. 2.10. Exod. 20.5. Pſal. 95.6.</note> To which may be added many ſuch cuſtomes as were of old in the Primitive times; as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> inſinuateth againſt all Innovatours, ſaying; <hi>We have no ſuch cuſtome, nor yet the Churches of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. So that from hence we have a plain Text in confutation of thoſe, who love to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend againſt the old ancient cuſtomes of the Church; as bowing towards the Altar, praying
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:18609:90"/>towards the Eaſt, ſtanding up at the Creed, Goſpell, and at <hi>Gloria Patri;</hi> with ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like. Yea, and may from hence alſo gather, that the reſtoring of ancient Canons, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the beſt times, (ſuch as are ſome of thoſe already mentioned) may better be revived, than ſottiſh devices of I know not whom; eſpecially ſuch cuſtomes as the circumſtances of our times and places will beſt permit, or be as well for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent order and edification to us as to them. For even <hi>Beza</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth,<note place="margin">Bez. Confeſſ. Chriſt. ſidei, c. <hi>5.</hi> ſect. <hi>22.</hi>
                     </note> that particular Synods, called by the Metropolitan of a place, are of ſingular uſe, as amongſt other things, ſo to reduce matters of Ceremony to edification: <hi>Vt omnia ad aediſicationem referantur,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>That all things may be referred to edification.</hi> And if all things, then alſo Ceremonies; <hi>Veteribus ipſis Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonibus ad hunc finem revocatis.

For when certaine brethren at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> varied from the reſt about Circumciſion,<note place="margin">Act. 15.1.</note> they were overſwayed by the cenſure of the Councell held at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and not the Councell overſwayed by them.

                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.13.</note> that we ſubmit our ſelves not only to the Law of God, but alſo unto the ordinances of men; and that, for the

                     <hi>for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake.</hi> And in more particular, as it relates to Church officers, 'tis ſtill the ſame: (not thinke it warrantable to cheriſh and nouriſh your owne peccant humours; but) obey and ſubmit, as in the Text above mentioned out of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. To which alſo joyne that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>Act.</hi> 15.28. and then be rather fearfull to offend the Law, than your owne opinion. For,<note place="margin">Act. 15.28.</note> 
                     <hi>It ſeemeth good</hi> (ſay the Apoſtles) <hi>to the Holy Ghoſt and to us, to lay upon you no greater burthen.</hi> Where note, that what ſome thought burthen ſome, was rather good and neceſſary: and therefore to ſlip downe this bitter pill of diſobedience, and to give way to an erroneous conſcience, is to ſtraine at a Gnat, and ſwallow a Camell.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.16.</note> But <hi>be not righteous over much, neither make thy ſelf over wiſe. for why ſhouldeſt thou deſtroy thy ſelfe?</hi> as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture elſewhere ſpeaketh. In which words (mee thinkes) it is, as if a finger were pointed from thence to the Preciſians of our times, whoſe very doubting is dangerous: for it corrupts their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and ſo, makes them guilty of a certaine ſinne. Wherefore it is more ſafe to obey doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, than to diſobey doubtingly: for wee may not by diſobeying commit a certaine ſinne, in ſeeking to prevent a probable, but contingent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience; as even the Authour of the <hi>Holy Table</hi> hath declared.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, doubts (ſaith another) may be
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18609:92"/>of two kindes; either Speculative, or Practicall. If a doubt be only ſpeculative, of the lawfulneſſe of ſuch things as lye in a mans owne liberty to doe or forbeare, then to doe a thing doubting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is a ſinne; <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. But if the doubt bee practicall, and the matter of it a thing comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by authority, that doubting doth neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, nor excuſe diſobedience; <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.</p>
                  <p>The exceptions from this Rule are very few; to wit, in caſes only when Superiours command that which doth expreſly oppoſe an Article of our Faith, one of the ten Commandements, or the generall ſtate and ſubſiſtence of God's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church. So then, bee a man never ſo zealous, ſtrict of life, or highly eſteemed for his perſonall endowments; yet he may be more ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than he needs, or contentious than hee ſhould: For it were a madneſſe not to know, that the moſt ſanctified and zealous men are men, and may therefore have ſome faults as well as others: For though all be not guilty of ſinnes in one kind; yet <hi>In multis labimur omnes,</hi> in many things wee ſinne all. And if all in many things, then the beſt have ſome faults: and this (whilſt thus) is one, even among thoſe of high eſteeme, be all their other actions never ſo good, zealous, devote, or what you pleaſe to call them. One, did I ſay? Yes; and that a great one too: why elſe is diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience likened to the ſinne of witchcraft, and every ſoule (without exception) commanded to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18609:92"/>obey and ſubmit? as formerly hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nor is it but augmented alſo in regard of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: for whilſt they whom we take to bee good men ſhall ſtumble, and refuſe to yeeld to the government under which they live, others are the ſooner brought to doe the like; and ſo the Church troubled, not only by themſelves, but by ſuch alſo as are too forward to tread in the ſteps of their proceedings. Let them be loath therefore to cheriſh ſuch timerous conceits, as ſhall from an errour in judgement, make them at the laſt be guilty of ſome ſinful practice ariſing from thence. For no mans goodneſſe is good in this, nor may exempt them from the obedience unto Lawes, nor make them be<note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 4.15.</note> priviledged to put their hands into bad actions: eſpecially ſince ſuch mens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity would but incourage others to preſume upon the like favour.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> I confeſſe ſpeaketh to the <hi>Romans; Let not him that eateth, deſpiſe him that eateth not: and let not him that eateth not, judge him that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Rom.</hi> 14.3. But from thence can bee no warrant to take liberty, either for conforming, or not conforming, for the caſe is not the ſame. There the marter of difference was not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in the nature of it, but was alſo left ſo as concerning the uſe; the Church had ſet down no Law concerning it. But is it ſo with us? 'tis not; and therefore obedience is required on our parts, without any queſtion for conſcience ſake;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18609:93"/>we are elſe no dutifull Sonnes of the Church, but a peeviſh and perverſe generation, who are not afraid to act the Vipers part, within the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells of our holy Mother.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall tell you what Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> did: That pious Father once (in the behalfe of his Mother <hi>Monica</hi>) conſulted with Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> about the like occaſion, about matters of ceremonie. For ſhe being doubtfull what to doe, he went to Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who told him thus: When <hi>I come to the Church of Rome, I faſt on the Saturday; and when I am here, I doe not. So thou alſo, unto whatſoever Church thou commeſt, follow the orders thereof; if thou wouldeſt not ſcandalize any, nor have any to offend thee:</hi> which when he had told to his Mother, ſhe reſted ſatisfied. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, even Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> alſo giveth this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, <hi>In his rebus in quibus nihil certi ſtatuit Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura divina, mos populi Dei, vel inſtituta majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum pro lege tenenda ſunt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither doe our owne Stories of the Church but tell us, that even ſuch as ſuffered Martyrdome for the truth, made no ſcruple of conſcience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the orders of our Church. <hi>Bucer</hi> (for his owne part) approved of our Engliſh Liturgie, although at the firſt he made ſome doubt. Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi> went to the ſtake cheerefully, wearing a Tippet of Velvet, and a corner Cap: and yet (as that good old Father <hi>Latimer</hi> Prophecied) at his burning, there was ſuch a candle lighted in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18609:93"/>
                     <hi>England,</hi> as ſhall never be put out. <hi>Iohn Philpot</hi> was an Arch-deacon, and Dr. <hi>Rowland Taylour</hi> uſed the Service booke to his great comfort, all the time of his impriſonment; and commended it at his death, a the laſt token of his love to his deare wife. Maſter <hi>Hullier</hi> alſo a godly Miniſter, burnt at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> moſt joyfully embraced the ſayd booke, even in the very flames, Theſe you will ſay were good and gooly men; but had they ſacrificed their lives in a factious quarrell againſt Clericall habits, or other comely ceremonies of the Church, enjoyned by King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, their Religious Soveraigne; the authour of the Acts and Monuments had never numbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them among the glorious Martyrs of Chriſt, as a reverend Doctour well obſerveth.</p>
                  <p>And now alſo ſecondly,<note place="margin">An anſwer to the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> whereas ſome make doubt of the lawfulnes of Spirituall juriſdiction, or Courts Eccleſiaſticall: I think there is enough in the former anſwer, to yeeld ſatisfaction even in this, here therefore I ſhall need to ſay the leſſe. For can a Superiour have power to make Lawes, and not have power to puniſh where they bee transgreſſed? or ſhall the civill Magiſtrate not hold his ſword in vaine,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.4.</note> and muſt the Prelates ſtand for cyphers with their keyes?

                     <note place="margin">Math. 18.17.</note> But to what purpoſe, if there be in the Church no power of juriſdiction? Yes, to perſwade ſay ſome; or to rebuke with words. Nay ſure, 'tis more then
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18609:94"/>ſo: for in our Saviours ſpeech, there is mention made of binding and looſing.<note place="margin">Verſe 18.</note> And, what will you (ſayth Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>ſhall I come unto you with a rod,</hi>

                  <p>But to put all out of queſtion, ſee what the Apoſtle writes to <hi>Timothie,</hi> the firſt Biſhop of the <hi>Epheſians:</hi> namely, that againſt a Prieſt [or Elder] he muſt receive no accuſation,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.19.</note> under two or three witneſſes: where I would that you marke theſe particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> That here is an accuſer, here is a perſon accuſed, here is an examination of witneſſes, here is a judgement and deciding of the matter; therefore here is an exerciſe of juriſdiction, and a Court for determining of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall affaires.</p>
                  <p>What then remaineth, but that the Officers belonging to ſuch Iudicatures, make upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe their ayme; that thereby all juſt cauſe of ſcandall may bee taken away from theſe their lawfull Courts. For when they have done their beſt, either ignorance, or malice, or both, will be readie enough to traduce them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo much the more are they like to be exclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt, when indirect courſes are plaine and manifeſt. But herein care muſt be had, that the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:18609:94"/>ſcandall of injuſtice be not layd upon ſuch as are free enough from it. If ſome baſe minded under Officers abuſe their places; it is no good argument to prove, that therefore Biſhops are maintainers of unjuſt practiſes. For we know for certaine, the Church (like a carefull Mother) hath provided Laws to ſuppreſſe ſuch abuſes, as ſhe feared might be foſtered in theſe her Courts. Witneſſe thoſe many Canons concerning the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of Arch biſhops,<note place="margin">See the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of out Church.</note> Biſhops and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons; yea, concerning Iudges, Proctors, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters, and Apparatours. As in Canon the 92. that none bee cited into divers Courts for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of the ſame Will. And in Canon 115, that Miniſters and Churchwardens bee not ſued for preſenting: And in the 116, and 117 Canons, that Churchwardens bee not troubled for not preſenting oftner then twice a yeare, excepting at Viſitations, or that the cuſtome of the Dioces be otherwiſe: And, in Canon the 121, that none be cited into ſeverall Courts for one and the ſame crime, but that the officers cerrifie each to other what hath beene preſented to them: And, in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non the 123, that no act be ſped but in open Court: And in Can. 127. 128. that Iudges and Surrogates be well qualified: And in Canon the 129, that no Proctors retaine cauſes unlawfully: And, in Canon the 133, that Proctors be not cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous in Courts: And, in Canon the 134, that Regiſters abuſe not their places: And, in Canon
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18609:95"/>the 135, that no Eccleſiaſticall officer exact more than his ordinary fees: And, in Can. 136, that a Table of their ſaid feees be ſet up in open view in Courts and Regiſters: And, in Canon the 138, that Apparitours ſhall not take upon them the office of Promoters or Informers for the Court. All which had beene never done, if the Prelates had intended the upholding of wrong and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery: for by theſe Conſtitutions it well appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that they are no wayes bent to countenance the courſes of unjuſt proceedings, but to puniſh and ſubdue all ſuch offenders. And therefore to be (as many I thinke are) too ready to blame Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, for maintainers of pouling Courts, is (as one truly ſpeakes) a matter in a ſlanderer to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and not a fault in a Biſhop to be blamed. In a word, ſuch is the generall looſeneſſe of theſe miſerable times,<note place="margin">This was proved true a long while ſince; as may be ſeen in an old ancient booke called an Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the people of England; printed, anno Dom 1589.</note> that all kinde of juſtice (among too many) is growne into hatred and contempt: and men diſdaine to bee ruled by it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they are called, convented, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſuch things wherein they have offended, or be bridled from that they would do diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they grudge at it; their ſtomackes riſe againſt it, and thinke all that is done to be unlawfull, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be never ſo juſt. And becauſe they are not able otherwiſe to be revenged, they cry out that they be cruell and pouling Courts. But as I ſaid before in advice to officers, <hi>Let uprightneſſe be their ayme:</hi> ſo now to offenders, in the words
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:18609:95"/>of God by his holy Prophet;<note place="margin">Eſay 5.18.20, 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Woe be to them that draw on iniquity with cords of vanity, and ſin as it were with a cartrope; that call good evil &amp; evil good, that put light for darknes, and darknes in the ſtead of light:</hi> that thereby they may the better nouzle themſelves in feigned colours, and imagined ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes; although in ſo doing, they do but like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that wicked generation, <hi>Who curſe their Father, and doe not bleſſe their Mother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhould now come to the next particular, were it not that ſtil I find another thing, which the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious firſt, and others next, diſtaſte and ſleight too much. And that's the celebration of ſuch holy dayes, as they who live within the pale of our Church are urg'd to keepe. But let mee tell them, that in this they alſo go aſtray.

                     </note> breach of the fourth Commandement, and ſo a ſinne, to make more Holy Dayes than one in ſeven: yet ſhall they never be able to prove why it ſhould be a ſinne rather now than heretofore. For ſhall the Iewes be no tranſgreſſors of the Law, though they have more daies than their weekly Sabbath; and muſt the Chriſtian offend in conſecrating dayes beſide the Sunday? Yes, ſay ſome; for they were led thereunto by God's expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. For ſome, I grant, they were: but for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome againe they were appointed no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than their Church ordained.<note place="margin">Eſter 9.21.</note> For did they not every yeare ſolemnize and keepe holy the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18609:96"/>fourteenth and fifteenth day of the moneth <hi>Adar,</hi> in remembrance of their great delivery from the treaſon of <hi>Haman?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Mac. 4.59.</note> And had they not likewiſe their yearly feaſt of <hi>Dedication;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 10.22.23</note> for the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which there was no precept, and yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe refuſed not to obſerve it with them? 'Tis ſure they had. And therefore to ſay, <hi>Sixe dayes thou ſhalt labour,</hi> and not let to keepe holy any other day than one, is an idle cavil, and ſcarce worth the anſwering. Howbeit, for thy further ſatisfaction, take this alſo with thee; that God, who might challenge all our time for his worke, doth there ſhew that he is willing to remit<note n="*" place="margin">Which part is ordinarily ſix dayes, though not alwayes; as the Iewes themſelves do beare us witneſſe.</note> part of his right for thine owne workes: yet ſo, as he doth not reſtraine thee from doing publike ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him, on any of thoſe dayes which the Church ſhall appoint: for except there be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious ends aymed at on the dayes ſet apart, this which I ſay muſt needs be granted.</p>
                  <p>But ſay ſome againe, though we yeeld to the obſerving of ſuch weekly dayes as are either in honour of the Saviour of the world, for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of ſome judgment, or for the teſtification of thankes for ſome great benefit; yet why ſhould the Church preſſe upon us the keeping of Saints dayes too as well as theſe? Why? becauſe the righteous ſhall be had in everlaſting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh:<note place="margin">Pſal. 112.6.</note> and the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the juſt be bleſſed;<note place="margin">Prov. 10.8.</note> as the ſonne of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt hath expreſſed. Or becauſe of that knot of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18609:96"/>fellowſhip which is betweene the dead Saints and the living, this being that Communion which we confeſſe and beleeve in the Apoſtles Creed: ſo that as they pray to God for our good in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; in like manner we praiſe God for them in particular, account their memory precious, ſet their examples before us, as the glaſſes of our lives, and deſire to be made partakers with them of the glorious reſurrection in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>I would to God therefore that none but Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes were guilty of this ſinne in ſleighting ſuch Holy Dayes: others alſo cut off their eſteeme more than is meet. For, that I may cloſe up all with full ſatisfaction, our Church appoints no ſet dayes for titular Saints, ſuch is are many in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> but for ſuch as were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Evangeliſts, and Martyrs indeed; whom Chriſt honoured ſo much as to make ſome of them eſtabliſhers, and others as it were founders of that Kingdome which coſt him his deareſt blood; and accounted them worthy to ſuffer death for his ſake: ſo that (as one truly ſaith,<note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Dow</hi> of the Sabbath and Lords Day, pag. 62.64.</note> and I ſpeake it in his owne words) we may juſtly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize either the dayes wherein thoſe burning and ſhining Lights firſt appeared to the world, or the dayes of their departure hence, which were the dayes of their happy inauguration into the Kingdome of Glory, when they both left to the Church Militant the glorious example of their Chriſtian fortitude, and became an occaſion of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18609:97"/>new joy to the Church Triumphant, by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of new citizens to that heavenly ſociety. On which dayes we honour God as the authour of all that good which either they, or we by them are partakers of: for our prayers and prayſes are to him, though with reference to them in what they have done. So that they are honoured only as God's inſtruments, and as thoſe who having beene imitatours of our bleſſed Saviour, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy patternes of our imitation. Neither is ſuch a day more holy than another, but in relation to the ſeparation of it to ſuch holy and religious duties, which the Church ordaineth to be performed on it. And therefore, leſt in the revolution of time, ingratefull forgetfulneſſe ſhould obliterate the bleſſed memory of ſuch juſt ones, we have theſe ſolemne Feaſts, and ſet Dayes, in an annuall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of them, to the glory of him whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments they were.</p>

                  <p>The old Phariſee was therefore in this an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man. Hee would not rob the Church, but payed tithes of all that he poſſeſſed: not neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much as Mint, Anniſe, and Rue.

                  <p>Howbeit men (for the moſt part) now are of another minde. For that which God requires (not only as a token of his Univerſall dominion, and liberall donation, but) as a meanes to uphold his worſhip and ſervice, is too eagerly cried down by them who rob the Church; ſaying, (as did <hi>Iudas</hi> of the precious ointment) <hi>Ad quid perdito haec? Wherefore is all this waſte?</hi> For thus do the ſacrilegious worldlings in their hungry zeale, gape after the ſpoile and ruine of the Church.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18609:100"/>And although many of them may perhaps ſeeme more devote than the reſidue of that crew, yet may we expect as little good from them to the Church of God, as from the reſt who march more openly. For many will goe with the Wiſemen from the Eaſt to ſeeke Chriſt; yea, and will fall downe and worſhip him: but they are grown too wiſe to open their treaſures; except it be in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a ſcant almes to a wandring Levite, fitting to their fancies: or if more, perhaps ſome miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>mod cum</hi> by way of ſtipend to a diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Separatiſt, who beareth as little love to the Church in her Governours, as they in her reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes or honourable maintenance. This makes us heare much talke many times of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencies, ſtipends, and benevolence: But as for tythes, if the Clergy ſhould have them all, then farewell to the Laity, cry theſe ſmall friends to God Almighty. They would therfore that tythes ſhould be every where aboliſhed (excepting from their owne hands) that thereby they may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bring the Prieſts to impotency, ſcorne and miſery: Not remembring, that (whilſt they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make theſe things Lay fees) they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are like to ſuffer for it, both in the want of a zealous and learned Miniſtery, as alſo for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring of holy things. I will a little touch upon both theſe.</p>
                  <p>Want of meanes is (firſt of all) a means to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der free ſpeaking. To live upon courteſie, is to

                  <p>Next, for a deſtruction to themſelves in more particular, ſee this Text of Scripture, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.25. By reaſon of which teſtimony I remember theſe words: Let it be proved (ſaith one) that God hath aſſigned tythes to Gentlemen, and I will cleare them from that menace of <hi>Solomon</hi> [in the foreſaid Text] namely, that <hi>It is a deſtruction
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:18609:101"/>to devoure that which is holy.</hi> Which is as if it ſhould be ſaid, They that are guilty of this ſinne, doe but ſucke in a bitter ſweet, a faire-ſeeming purchaſe, but a deſtroying poſſeſſion; a deſired bait with a wounding hooke; a ſacrificed morſell with a burning coale, apt and fit to kindle a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both againſt them and theirs, who deſire (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh) to take unto themſelves the houſes of God in poſſeſſion.<note place="margin">Pſal. 83.</note> It is therefore generally obſerved among all nations, that there was ever a maine difference ſet betwixt that which was dedicated to divine worſhip, and that which was for common or vulgar uſe. Which difference not obſerved, was judged even by the Heathens themſelves, to be an incurable crime; and the actour thereof, not to be ordinarily evill, but a creature compoſed of inexpiable villanies, as <hi>Saravia</hi> obſerveth out of <hi>Plato de Legibus, Dial.</hi> 9. And verily we finde it to be one of the moſt capitall offences tha is purſued with Divine revenge, as both the holy Scriptures, and ſtories Eccleſiaſticall have recorded.</p>

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:18609:101"/>quaffing in the Veſſells of the Temple (not taken away by himſelfe, but by his Grandfather) was an eye-witneſſe to the inſcription of his owne doome,<note place="margin">Dan. 5.</note> written upon the plaiſtered wall of his ſtately Palace. <hi>Alchimus</hi> likewiſe, who ſought to overthrow the Temple at <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> was ſtricken with a palſey, and died miſerablie.<note place="margin">1 Mac. 9.55.56.</note> 
                     <hi>Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus,</hi> and his companions, who came to take away the holy treaſures, both ſaw, and felt the power of God againſt them. <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Mac. 3.24.</note> who had ſpoyled the Temple,<note place="margin">2 Mac. <hi>c.</hi> 5. &amp;c. 9.</note> &amp; vowed to make <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> a place of buriall; was (in the height of his pride) purſued by divine puniſhment. <hi>Iudas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 12.6: Matth. c. 26. &amp;c. 27.</note> who firſt of alrobbed Chriſt, and afterwards ſold him to the chiefe Prieſts, became his owne accuſer, judge, and hangman. <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphyra,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 5.3.4.</note> for keeping backe part of what they had devoted to the Church, were ſuddenly deſtroyed: which fact of theirs (as <hi>Saravia</hi> hath well obſerved) though it were more excuſeable then if they had done ſo with others monie, could not avoyd the high hand of Heaven; and therefore remaines as the great terrour to all Chriſtians. Their death was <hi>coelitus immiſſa;</hi> and therefore God therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that even now in the times of the Goſpel. he himſelfe is a puniſher of theſe wicked offences.

                  <p>Firſt, that God is well pleaſed to ſee us dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate our goods to holy uſes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that things ſo dedicated, are (after

Of which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bee our Biſhops lands, Gleabe lands, and ſuch like other portions given to the Church by pious Princes, and other zealous Chriſtians. I doe not ſay that Abbie lands are of the ſame nature: For as it is certaine that the <hi>Popes,</hi> and <hi>Monkes</hi> did in many things rob the Church of what belonged to thoſe who did the ſervices therein. So they did alſo in as many things (or more) robbe and wrong the Common-weale; which was done, not upon the calling, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but upon the corrupting of Churches; whereas the lands of Biſhopricks were given pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently upon the planting of Churches, before they were corrupted with prevailing Hereſies, or Superſtion;<note place="margin">

                     </note> no ſtorie being able to ſhew, that ever there was a Church planted in the beſt times; but either lands were committed to the government of the Biſhops, for the uſe of the Church, and them in their government, or elſe the price was brought to them who had the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as in this of <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> is apparent. And therefore though ſuch Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall poſſeſſions (as they commonly called them) which were gotten by fraud, or force, and uſurped againſt all right, or given at firſt to a

In which regard the Impropriations alſo, though taken from the Monkes, who tooke them from the Church, cannot be of right given to any other uſe, then to the upholding and maintaining of Gods worſhip, and thoſe who do the ſervices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and laſt of all, from hence we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe learne; that they who do either keep back, or take away any part of that portion lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted; doe it becauſe they want the true feare of God, or (as it is in the words of that Text) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Sathan hath filled their hearts.

                  <p>And againe, how many Stories relate the plagues which fell upon <hi>Iulian</hi> for his Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and Sacriledge? who (in deriſion of Chriſt and Chriſtians) when hee had ſtripped the Church and Biſhops of all they had; told them that in ſo doing, he had an eſpeciall care of their ſoules health, becauſe the Goſpell commended poverty to them.

And although all and every offender a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Churches right, hath not on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den met with ſpeedie vengeance; yet let not this embolden any: for God puniſheth ſome with ſudden and remarkeable judgements, that others may take warning. But if after all they will not be warned, he is as juſt to them (in what way beſt pleaſeth him) as to others guilty of the like wickedneſſe: They fare no better then their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours; their judgement ſleepeth not. It is a favour (if men could ſee it) that hee proceeds many times but ſlowly to revenge: But his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience being abuſed, he turnes his favour into the more bitter frownes: and ſo, though it be <hi>Lento ſaepe interitu;</hi> yet it is <hi>certo tamen</hi> to every one not freeing themſelves out of that ſnare where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are taken. Remember therefore, that <hi>Optimum eſt aliena frui inſania;</hi> or to be warned by another mans harmes, is a great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>Or otherwiſe thus. The wrath of God (ſayth one) is either a ruine ſuddainly throwing downe, or a net catching; and after a certaine
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18609:103"/>time deſtroying: Yea, the Lord threatneth, that ſometimes <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhould finde him as a moth,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 5.12.14</note> ſometime as a Lyon: As a Lyon hee devoureth ſpeedily; and as a moth, hee conſumeth by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Which is fitly applied to the Robbers of the Church; for whil'ſt they are bent wholy upon the prey, they forget the ſnare; and on the ſudden are not able to feele it.

And therefore a man cannot be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecured from this ſometimes ſlow comming evill, then by removing the moth, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>removed muſt needes conſume him.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18609:104"/>to take no care for the matter, becauſe he would defend his owne Church; as he did, by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of an hill upon the Hoſt by a ſtrange earth quake, terrifying the reſt that remained with tempeſts of haile, thunder, and lightnings; wherein <hi>Brennus</hi> was alſo ſo ſorely wounded, that like one impatient of his ſufferings, hee ſlew himſelfe with his owne hand.</p>

                  <p>But I will rather proceed to that which I firſt intended; namely, to ſhew the divine right of Tythes, and to declare that where they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated, there God and his Church are rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. For can it be thought that man is wiſer to order theſe things, better than God hath done? Or is it reaſonable that the rewards of our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſhould bee imbezeled into the hands of Lay-poſſeſſours for doing nothing? What is become of Conſcience, or true pietie, if in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that they may, men tremble not at it?</p>
                  <p>It is not enough to vouch preſcription for the infeofment of Lay-patrons: for if <hi>nullum tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus occurit Regi,</hi> that is; if no cuſtome can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe againſt an earthly King, much leſſe againſt the King of Heaven and earth. For firſt, by right originall Tythes are the Lords: And ſecondly,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18609:104"/>by way of aſſignation they appertaine to the Church in the officers thereof, and this for the ſervice that they doe. To put us therefore off with ſtipends, courteſie, and benevolence; is to alter Gods order, and to tye us to ſuch meane modicums, as are commonly both ſcant, and uncertaine; which is a thing miſerable, and not honourable. And yet ſayth the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.17.</note> 
                     <hi>He that ruleth well is not onely worthie of honour, but of double honour.</hi> Wherefore let mee tell you in a ſtorie what I have read in print to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. There was once a certaine Seigniour, who came to one of the Images of our Ladie, and threw into the baſon an angel of gold; at which the Image made a low &amp; humble courteſie: Now his manſtanding by, and ſeeing this, did much admire the matter; and becauſe hee alſo would have a curteſie, hee purpoſed to throw in ſomething; whereupon hee put in ſixe pence, and tooke out his Maſters angell. So alſo they that robbe the Church, of what was once her ancient revenews, if they leave her but any thing (be the moitie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſmall) they looke for curteſie and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and would that the Clergie ſhould thinke themſelves well that they have any thing left.</p>
                  <p>But be not deceived; For as <hi>Malachie</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Malach. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Yea, ſo exactly doth the Lord require his Tenth, as he cannot in any caſe endure the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing thereof: Encreaſed it may be, by the more zealous, and thankefull; but not dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Whereupon the people of Iſrael were ſtrictly charged, that no man ſhould exchange, or make compoſition for his Tythes, except he would give for them a ſiſt part more then the price thereof, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27.31.

                  <p>It is proved then, that we may claime a part in all: and if a part in all, why not that part or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in all ages hath beene paid, untill the Church was robbed? For though in thoſe words of the Apoſtle formerly mentioned, there be no expreſſe mention of a tenth part; yet if Scripture, may be expounded by Scripture, wee ſhall find no other part aſſigned than a tenth: No not now. For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt were the law of Tythes abrogated, then he would have ſhewed ſome other way, how the people might make their Teachers to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in all their goods; but ſeeing hee ſheweth no
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:18609:106"/>other way, it muſt needs be as it was before; for no poſitive ſanction can reverſe Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If he hath once ſpoken thus, or thus it ſhal be; ſhew me then I pray you who can alter it but himſelfe: <hi>Si princeps cauſam inter partes audierit, et ſententiam dixerit; lex eſt in omnibus ſimilibus:</hi> which rule doth much more hold, as it is applia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the King of Heaven. And therefore what hath beene once commanded in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth remaine a Law for ever, except (as Mr. <hi>Robarts</hi> truly ſpeaketh) it hath beene ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed; which is no where to be ſhewed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning tythes, either directly or indirectly. Never was this right diſclaimed, nor removed to a new rate: And therefore, whereas the Lord having formerly both challenged and received; under the Law, and before the Law, not only a part, but ſpecially, and by name a tenth part, (as I ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhew you;) it is our duty ſtill to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and performe for Gods due, not a part (wee know not which) but even this knowne particularly deſcribed Tenth. For as in the caſe of divorce, Chriſt ſent the Scribes and Phariſees, to ſee how it was, <hi>Ab initio;</hi> ſo in this caſe of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for Gods Miniſters, Inquire of the old wayes, and when you find that in the beginning it was not ſo, as ſacrilegious perſons now would have it, nor commanded ſince that it ſhould be ſo, you may conclude without any more adoe, that the <hi>Quota pars</hi> is ſtill a tenth. And indeed (that

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:18609:107"/>the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Lord hath ordained, that they who preach the Goſpel, ſhould liue of the Goſpel,</hi> there muſt be ſome ordinance of the Lord ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning this of which hee ſpeaketh: but none can be ſhewed, excepting that of old. The Apoſtles times were extraordinary, and ſuch as they could be, where Perſecution put all things out of ſquare; yea, ſuch as they could be in the firſt founding of a Church, the Planters and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers being ſent from place to place, and things not ſetled till a long while after, as anon ſhall bee further ſhewed. Here therefore was no ordinance for a continued maintenance: Their taking of benevolence proves no ſuch thing, no more than their going from place to place, proveth that a Church ſhould be always unſetled. And therfore his Ordinance was of old; &amp; ſo this <hi>[Even ſo]</hi> can plead for nothing elſe to bee ordinarily received, than tythes and offerings; for <hi>Even ſo hath the Lord ordained.</hi> And why, <hi>Even ſo, or after the ſame manner?</hi> but becauſe Gods part is certainly annexed to Gods worſhip: the rate or meaſure whereof (beſide offerings) is ſaid to be a tenth of all that, wherewith the Lord (yeare by yeare) bleſſeth his people; this being that maine and principall tithe,<note place="margin">Deut. 18.1.</note> which (in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi>) is called the Tythe of Inheritance, as afterwards more fully ſhall be ſhewed.</p>

Thus that other.</p>
                  <p>Neither, thirdly is it, but that in the ſeventh Chapter to the <hi>Hebrewes, Levi</hi> is ſaid to pay tythes unto Chriſt, becauſe <hi>Abraham,</hi> (in whoſe

                  <p>By this very light, it was that the Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

It is no ſhame for us to gather good out of their examples. It were a ſhame ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that a falſe God ſhould bee more honoured than the true. Wee may avoid their ſuperſtition, but imitate their zeale: otherwiſe they walke better by the dimme light of Nature, than wee who have both the light of Nature, and of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to direct us.</p>
                  <p>I doe not ſay, or thinke, that in the payment of their tythes, Nature taught them the juſt portion of a Tenth: For though the ſubſtance of this duty was <hi>Lex inſcita,</hi> yet the other was by way of imitation, taken from the example of the ancient Patriarkes, to whom the will of God was better revealed then to the Heathens. Thus alſo think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that learned <hi>Brentius,</hi> in his Comment upon <hi>Leviticus, Chap.</hi> 27. <hi>Verſe</hi> the 30<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> How they had it from them, is not much materiall. It was,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:18609:111"/>without queſtion, time out of mind among them, as well as amongſt Gods people: And a man may as wel declare, who was the firſt that taught, <hi>Deos eſſe colendos;</hi> as who was the firſt that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, the Tenth part [rather then any other part] to bee the reſerved, and ſpeciall portion, appropriated to a Deitie.</p>
                  <p>In briefe, all theſe practiſes ſerve to ſhew, that by the law of Nature (as a part of Gods ſervice) all people knew themſelves bound to give ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to God, of thoſe temporall bleſſings, which God giveth unto them. This <hi>Something</hi> was no will worſhip unrequired, but looked for and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by the Giver of all; even from the firſt times of the worlds beginning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. It was likewiſe [for the <hi>Quetitie</hi>]<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 14.20. Heb. 7.4. Gen. 28.22. Levit. 27.30.</note> declared by the practice of the Patriarkes before the Law, and by the words recorded in the Law, to bee a Tenth. What was beſide, were thoſe Free-will Offerings and Oblations already mentioned: Preſents, but not Rents; And yet ſuch as God was, and is, wel pleaſed to receive.</p>
                  <p>Thus, then you have ſeene Gods right; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Tythes are the Lords, holy to the Lord: and therefore out of the power of man to turne them into common uſes.</p>
                  <p>Next, for the Aſſignation or Deputement of them to the Prieſthood, wee have againe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: That as the Lord did not begin to have a right in them, when the Law was given; ſo the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:18609:111"/>Aſſignment was not then, although but then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by a written Law: And therefore, as the Right was perpetuall; ſo the Aſſignment. For when God declared, why the Prieſts were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, hee affirmeth, <hi>That it was for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which they doe, Numb.</hi> 18.21. &amp; <hi>Deut.</hi> 18 5. And if for the ſervice, then not due to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites as the ſonnes of <hi>Levi,</hi> but as the Prieſts of God: Or, being due principally to the Service, and not to the Men, but for the ſake of the holy Function, &amp; maintenance of them in their places, it muſt needs follow, <hi>That where God is ſerved, there tythes are due to thoſe (in a ſecondary right)</hi> who adminiſter in the Prieſts office, and doe the ſervices belonging to it. Yea, thus have they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes followed Gods worſhip; as well before the Law, as under it: and why not now alſo under the Goſpel cannot bee ſhewed: For the end of their deputation ceaſeth not, no more now then it did before. Are not therefore Prieſthood and Tythes fitly called Twins? or (as Logicians ſpeake) are they not Relatives; have ever gone together: and (of Right) ought ſo to doe ſo long as God hath a Church, and Officers belonging to it? For in Gods Church the worke, for which Tythes were given, can never end: and therefore the wages cannot (without wrong) bee detained from thoſe, who doe the Services.</p>
                  <p>Neither can it bee denied, but that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, even of the legall Services (as reading the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18609:112"/>Law, expounding the Law, performing of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayers, bleſſing the people, and ſuch like) is ſtill of force. For there is nothing ceaſed but what was typicall: all elſe abideth, with what hath ever belonged to it. So that although it bee granted, that<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Viz.</hi> parts of ſacrifices, and ſuch like.</note> ſome portions belonging to the Levites are now ceaſed, becauſe the parts of thoſe Services, for which they were due, are aboliſhed and gone; yet that which was payed for the maine duties, and principall ſervices belonging to the ſubſtance of Religion, before any ſuch Ceremonies were commanded, is ſtill of force; and of right our lawfull hire: this being the full Tenth of all that increaſe, wherewith the Lord Almighty bleſſeth his people.</p>
                  <p>And although <hi>Cajetan</hi> by the name of Tenth, doth not underſtand the tenth part, but a certaine portion, which in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time was called a Tenth.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lippom.</hi> in Gen 14.</note> Yet <hi>Lippoman,</hi> ſeeking no ſuch eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, overthrowes his ſuppoſition, with a more downe-right dealing.

And that <hi>Adam</hi> taught his ſonnes to give Tythes and Firſt fruits to the Lord. Certaine it is, that they brought their Offerings at a ſet time, and to a choſen place [Gods Houſe] called by reaſon of the Lords more ſpeciall preſence there,<note place="margin">See <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.</note> Gods Face; that then and there they might offer unto the Lord, not immediately, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mediately by <hi>Adam,</hi> the Prieſt of God: for ſo the Lord expounds our offering to him, <hi>Numbers</hi> 5.8. <hi>To the Lord, even to the Prieſt.</hi> Or, as it is in the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.11. <hi>The people are ſaid to offer, when as they onely brought their Sacrifices, and the Prieſt offered for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:18609:113"/>
                  <p>Neither may this ſeeme ſtrange: For among Gods people, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> he that was the eldeſt of every family, was both the King, and the Prieſt over his owne family. Thus do the Hebrewes tell us, that the Prieſthood was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall <hi>annexum</hi> to the Birth-right.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:18609:115"/>yeerely? It was therefore a common practiſe, as well then, as under the Law, to pay their tythes to Gods Prieſts: and ſo, what was done before the Law in theſe duties, can no more ceaſe now after the Law, then Chriſt ceaſeth to be a Prieſt for ever, after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi>

                  <p>By all which Tenne teſtimonies (beſide other which might be gathered.) it well appeareth, that theſe godly Kings grounded their Lawes, for the performance of this dutie of paying Tythes upon the Law of God: and did not declare that by vertue of their Lawes they were firſt of all due; but, that by vertue of their Lawes the <hi>jus divinum</hi> was upheld, and the obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto commanded.

Howbeit, the fact doth not alwayes prove the Right; no not in this very thing: as it is at the 4.5, and 6. verſes of the forenamed Chapter; nor ever were things ſetled, or brought into their due order on a ſudden; witneſſe both our owne experience in what wee have ſeene, as alſo the experience which <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe had of the firſt times: why elſe did hee ſay, <hi>That the reſt he would ſet in order when he came,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.34?

And as Circumciſion was reſumed as ſoon as the eſtate of the Church could beare it: ſo tythes were reeſtabliſhed, as ſo one as the condition of the Church could ſuffer it.</p>

                  <p>Beſides; the Apoſtles, as their callings to the Miniſtery were immediate; ſo their gifts were extraordinary: and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> could preach without ſtudy; and ſo had much ſpare time for other buſines, wherein it was conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the preſent to get his living, rather then to require the tythes and offerings, as was wont to be done of old, by thoſe who did the ſervice; And why not require them, I have already ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Wereas wee, though God hath given us gifts, and theſe of ſundry meaſures, yet without ſtudy wee cannot doe ſo with them, as is fit wee ſhould. Wee therefore ſtudy both to increaſe them, and alſo profitably to employ them. And ſo doing wee have more reaſon to claime our juſt dues, then they of the firſt times: For meanes you know is requiſite; if for no other cauſe, yet for this: that wee may bee the better furniſhed with Bookes, and ſuch neceſſary helpes, as may make us the more able, to goe on the more powerfully in the workes of our calling; praying alwayes for Gods bleſſing upon our labours, and ſtudious endeavours: for it is not labour alone without prayer; nor prayer without paines-taking that can doe it. I my ſelfe have knowne this example, of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> working with his owne hands, not ſeldome urged againſt the honourable main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of our preſent Clergy: but we ſee (God be thanked) that it is to very little purpoſe.

                  <p>Moreover, tythes were payed to the Prieſts and Levites, in the time of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. And we know that the Iewiſh Synagogue muſt be firſt buried, before theſe duties could bee ordinarily performed towards the Miniſters of the Goſpel: and ſo, when the Synagogue was buried, and the ſtate of the Church of Chriſt ſuch, as could beare the practiſe of paying tythes, they were brought into uſe, in the Church of Chriſt, as formerly in the dayes of the Iewiſh Synagogue.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, in the Churches nonage, or firſt infancy, her Miniſters were but few, and unſetled: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as afterwards they were otherwiſe, and muſt then be hoſpitable, ready to entertaine, and be freely devoted to workes of Charity: but without thier due revenew how could they performe any part of this duty? for Charity wee know begins at home; and a man muſt firſt have wherewithall, before he can give.</p>
                  <p>It was not long therefore, before order was taken for their honourable maintenance. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vvas done at the very firſt; vvherein ſome Churches (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh) vvere more forward then others were: and unto this vvas added daily more and more; not in one kind alone,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Rob.</hi> pag. 61.</note> but in a ſecond. Inſomuch, that in a ſhort
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:18609:123"/>ſpace proviſion was made for the Miniſters of the Church two manner of wayes; partly by the bounty of well diſpoſed people, which tooke place at the firſt: and partly by tythes and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings (as ſoone as might bee) which were paid them <hi>More Levitarum,</hi> as formerly to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites. And herein <hi>Zanchie</hi> hath well collected what wee find in ancient Writers, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe revenues both of tythes and offerings were wont to be paid to the Biſhop of each Dioceſſe; at whoſe direction they were diſtributed among the Miniſters, appertaining to every ſuch diviſion. For in the beginning of thoſe times, the whole Clergy did in common attend the whole flocke, the Biſhop and the Miniſters for the moſt part li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (as it were) in common together. But when the Church began more and more to ſtretch out her armes over the world, or when the ſtate of it did require another courſe; namely, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men ſhould bee aſſigned to particular Cures, conſtantly to reſide among them (for by that meanes they could the better ſee to them, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, exhort, and comfort them) then every Miniſter had the tythes and oblations of his own pariſh: which fitly agreeth to that queſtionary direction of bleſſed Saint <hi>Paul; Who feedeth a flocke, and eateth not of the milke of the ſtocke? Say I theſe things as a man? or ſaith not the Law the ſame alſo?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now ſuppoſe it could be proved, that the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:18609:124"/>Primitive times paied no tythes for a long while together; no, not till towards the end of the firſt foure hundred yeeres; yet were this nothing againſt that right which the Church had alwayes to them. If the inconveniences which Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brought upon the Church, was an hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance concerning practiſe, what were this againſt the Right. <hi>A facto ad jus</hi> (as I have already ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is no good argument. And indeed [without ſuppoſe] this is certaine, that the practiſe, as well as the right, was manifeſted long before foure hundred yeares.

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:18609:125"/>by his people was called <hi>Martellus</hi>) becauſe ſiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome he had peace in his Kingdome, gave (for the moſt part) the Church eſtate for wages to his Souldiers: who being dead, and buried in St. <hi>Dennis</hi> Church, on the left ſide of the great Altar, was ſeene by night in the ſhape of a great Dragon, breaking the Sepulchre, to go out of the glaſſe windowes with great terrour. Thus he. But whether this laſt of his carrying out of the Grave betrue, yea, or no, it makes no matter, nor will I contend about it. Certaine it is, that he was a notable Church-robber: For <hi>Boniface</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> (who lived at the ſame time) complaines likewiſe of him; and is a witneſſe that he tooke away Monaſteries, Biſhoprickes, Church-rents, and poſſeſſions from the Clergie, and prophaned them, to Lay-hands as are ward of their military ſervice then done againſt the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razens.</hi> And for any man to thinke that Tythes were no part of this great Sacriledge, is to affirme that the Church as yet had no ſuch Rents: whereas it is witneſſed by the foreſayd <hi>Boniface, That the milke and wooll of Chriſts ſheepe, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his times, and the Lords flocke was neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: received</hi> (I ſay) <hi>Oblationibus quotidianis, ac Decimis fid lium; In the dayly oblations and Tythes of the faithfull.</hi> And in the dayes of the ſecond Councell at <hi>Maſcon</hi> (a Biſhopricke in the Dioceſſe of <hi>Lions</hi>) in the yeare 586 (which was 155 yeares before <hi>Martells</hi> death) Churches
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:18609:126"/>had their tenths payd them out of that annuall increaſe, wherewith God Almightie bleſſed his people. Nor hath it but beene already<note n="*" place="margin">See alſo S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Cyprian epiſt.</hi> 66. <hi>ſou lib.</hi> 1. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 9. where memion is made of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of tythes.

But howſoever, what is one Authour againſt more? and yet this one, in his laſt thoughts is nothing differing, but ſpeakes juſt like thoſe other already mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Well then, without further queſtion, here was the originall of Infeodations, and firſt beginning of lamentable Sacriledge in the alienation of Tythes from the Miniſters, or Churches, to the which they were payd.</p>
                  <p>And in the ſumme of the whole anſwere note, that at the firſt they that had poſſeſſions ſold them, and brought the money to the Apoſtles; this was about <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> And in other Churches collections were made, both for the neceſſities of the Saints, and of the Miniſters. Then after this, it was thought more convenient rather, that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:18609:126"/>ſuch as were minded to give, ſhould give the Lands themſelves, rather (I ſay) than the price of them, that thereby they might remaine as a perpetuall helpe to the Church. Here began the endowment of the Church with Gleab; and this is commonly attributed (out of <hi>Polidore Virgil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Polid. De in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. lib. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi>

And before Pariſhes were divided, theſe were at the diſpoſing of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and payd unto him for the uſe of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie within the Dioceſſe.

                     </note> the yeare 266, they were annexed to the Prieſts of particular Cures. For the defence of whom (that they might not bee wronged in their dues) there were certaine temporall men appointed, either by godly Kings, or by ſuch as gave Lands to the Church, to bee Patrons of Churches, or <hi>Defenſores Eccleſiarum;</hi> who might be readie to defend the Churches rights. And yet perhaps ſome particular pariſhes (which were by reaſon of ſuch Churches as were of Lay foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations) were not knowne till ſome while after: and yet not ſo long after as ſome have thought; For, by the fourth Canon of the Councell of <hi>Arauſicanum</hi> (held in the yeare 441.) it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that Pariſh Oratories, and Churches of Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundations, were even then to beſeene.</p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:18609:127"/>
                  <p>But what need I looſe my ſelfe in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? for let a man take theſe things which way hee pleaſeth, yet ſtill hee may ſee that tythes (as well as other Church goods) belonged, and were generally paid to the Clergy, either in their own Cures, or to the Biſhops for them, before the dayes of <hi>Charles Martell,</hi> who was the firſt that brought in the moſt manifeſt corruption concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their alienation: for albeit <hi>Iulian</hi> robbed the Church, yet hee did it as a Perſecutor, from whom no leſſe could be expected. And although the ſucceſſors of <hi>Martel</hi> were more honeſt, and reſtored ſomewhat backe againe, taking in Leaſe from the Churches (in regard of the imminent warres, and many invaſions of the enemy) ſuch parts as were retained; and doing all this with great circumſpection, hoping that under the favour of God in this neceſſity, they might thus, and not otherwiſe without prejudice doe it: yet the former example of <hi>Charles Martel</hi> was the more powerfull, and in ſucceeding times proved but as a dangerous Load-ſtarre to direct divers other countries to imitate his practiſe, and to prophane their greedy hands with the Prieſts maintenance, while on the other ſide the Pope did as faſt appropriate Parſonages to Abbies and Nunneries; which in thoſe blind times was thought to bee no wrong; it being commonly conceited, that preaching bred nothing but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:18609:127"/>ſchiſmes, and contentions: and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was no better way to ſave ſoules, then by the devotions of Monkes and Friars. Which alſo was a cauſe, as ſuperſtition more and more increaſed, to get no ſmall portions fraudulently from the hands of the deceived Laity; it being a conſtant practiſe to give and give evermore to thoſe idle Droanes, and fat-bellied Houſes, that thereby they might have the more ſpeedy paſſage out of feigned Purgatory. To which likewiſe adde, how the Popes againe (although they would have ſomewhat reſtrained the covetouſnes of the Monkes, when they ſaw the greatneſſe of it) fixed upon another project. For, that they might enrich their Favourites, friends, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, they would not ſeldome convert the tythes to their uſes.</p>
                  <p>And now, to countenance and helpe forward theſe practiſes, with a colour of warrantable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, <hi>Alexander de Hales</hi> began to broach a new Doctrine, concerning the right of tythes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knowne nor heard of among the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For this was the Doctrine of the Fathers, both Greek and Latine, that tythes are due to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, by the word of God, <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum literam,</hi> literally and preciſely, as they were in the old Teſtament to the Prieſts of the Law: whereas this <hi>Hales</hi> (who was about the yeare 1230) taught otherwiſe; namely, that it
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18609:128"/>was a part of the Morall Law, naturally written in the heart, that ſomething ſhould be paied: but as for the <hi>Quota pars,</hi> it had its dependance meerly upon the Iudiciall Law; and ſo the Tenth was onely poſitively due, and no otherwiſe: due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Lawes poſitively ſhould deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. In which Doctrine was inferred, that they who might make the Lawes indetermination of the <hi>Quotitie</hi> which was to be paid, might alienate, to ſeverall uſes, as much out of that portion as they pleaſed. The Schoole-men went after him in the ſame ſteps, &amp; to the utmoſt of their power ſtrained their wits for the upholding of ſuch a politike opinion. Howbeit, the event proved af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards extreamely pernicious: Firſt, in occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning that hereſie which held them as Almes: And ſecondly, in giving occaſion alſo to the civil power, to take from the Church not only the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of tythes, but to alienate them in the end from the Church &amp; Church-men to a meere civill uſe. Wherein yet one thing is obſerveable, that (although the times were darke) there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſome or other (beſide the Canoniſts) who oppoſed the abbettours of this new doctrine, and taught this point of tything, not after the corrupt tenets of the School-men, but as the Fathers had done before them: of which you may reade more in D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Carletous</hi> hiſtory of tythes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. And for the doctrine of the Fathers, ſee Doctor <hi>Tilleſley</hi> in his Catalogue of 72. teſtimonies,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:18609:128"/>cleane contrary to what was taught by <hi>Hales, Aquinas,</hi> and the reſt. And laſt of all; why, and how, they are within the compaſſe of the Morall, and not Ceremoniall, or Iudicial Lawes, (no, not for their <hi>Quotitie</hi>) I have already ſhewed. And therefore, as known by, &amp; paid in the name, and portion of a Tenth part, before the Law. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a man could find, ſomewhere in Gods word, an expreſſe command to the contrary. For looke but unto the time of the Law it ſelfe, which was the middle time between the time of Nature and of Grace, and you ſhall find (I grant) that the worſhip of God, in regard of the manner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is ceaſed ſince the Paſſion of Chriſt: but God hath cauſed the ceaſing of ſo much as is ceaſed, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.14.

But tythes (as hath beene proved) were no types of Chriſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their ſubſtance, nor in their circumſtance, but were only the maintenance of Gods publike worſhip; which being perpetuall, they alſo are perpetual. In a word, they did belong to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God before there was a Leviticall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:18609:129"/>and when they were paid to the Levites, they did but follow Gods worſhip, as being prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally due to the ſervice, and not to the men, but for the ſervice ſake: and ſo alſo ſtill; ſuch muſt be their end of Aſſignation. For <hi>Levi</hi> ſhould have had as little portion in them, as any of the other Tribes, if God had not choſen him from the reſt to the Miniſtery, <hi>Num.</hi> 18.21. And as for Lay-men (beſides this, that they doe no ſervice) the very name of Impropriation pleads againſt them. I ſhall ſtil therefore urge, that what the Patriarkes, and old people of the Iewes practiſed by the Law of nature, or the rule of right reaſon, or by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Gods ſpirit many hundred yeers before the Ceremoniall or Leviticall Law was given, are not to be ranked among Iudaicall Ceremonies, which were fulfilled in our Saviour Chriſt, and were by him taken away, &amp; nailed to his Croſſe.</p>
                  <p>This is all: for I know nothing elſe of moment which can bee objected. And therefore here an end of this Diſcourſe; which may be, to the faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a Correction of their errours, if they will: if not, they have juſt cauſe to feare it as a witneſſe one day to bee brought forth againſt them. For what have I done, but declared ſuch truths as the Scriptures, Fathers, Councils, and other Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of good authority have recorded?</p>
